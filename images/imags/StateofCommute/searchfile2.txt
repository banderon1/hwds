$100,000 and $139,999 telecommuted, compared with only about two percent of workers with incomes below $30,000 and six percent of workers with incomes between $30,000 and $59,999. Four in ten (39%) respondents with annual household incomes of $180,000 or more telecommuted. As shown in Table 21, telecommuting also increased with increasing commute distance. Only 12% of respondents who lived less than one mile from work telecommuted, while three in ten (30%) respondents who commuted 30 miles or more telecommuted. There were no significant differences in telecommuting by home or work areas: Inner Core, Middle Ring, and Outer Ring. Table 21 also illustrates which groups have the greatest potential for future telecommuting. That is, in which groups would non-telecommuters be most likely to telecommute in the future, if given the opportunity? The last column in the table shows percentages of non-telecommuters who believe their job responsibilities would allow telecommuting and who would like to telecommute. This is the group referred to as “could and would.” In general, the groups with the highest current use of telecommuting show the greatest additional potential and groups with low current telecommuting also show low potential. But some groups had noticeably higher potential than the 28% average among all nontelecommuters. These included highincome respondents ($100,000 or more annual income) and respondents with longer than average commute distances (15 miles or more).

Sources of Telecommute Information
Respondents who telecommuted were asked how they had learned about telecommuting and if they had received telecommute information from Commuter Connections or MWCOG, either from Commuter Connections or from an MWCOG web site. The most frequently mentioned sources are shown in Figure 44. The largest source of information, by far, was “special program at work/employer,” named by seven in ten (71%) of respondents. This percentage was considerably higher than in the 2007 survey, in which only 55% of telecommuters cited their employer as the source of information and higher still compared with the 34% who gave this answer in 2004. Fifteen percent said they “initiated the request on their own” and five percent said they learned of telecommuting through “word of mouth.” Both had declined as telecommute information sources since 2007, when they were named by 23% and 13%, respectively Six percent of telecommuters said they received telecommute information directly from Commuter Connections or MWCOG. This was about the same percentage as mentioned Commuter Connections/MWCOG in each of the previous three SOC surveys: 2007 (7%), 2004 (5%), and 2001 (5%).

TELECOMMUTE PATTERNS
Respondents who said they telecommuted, at least occasionally, were asked a series of questions about their telecommute characteristics including: length of time telecommuting, use of informal or formal telecommute arrangement, telecommute location, frequency of telecommuting, and access mode to telework locations outside the home.

Figure 45
Length of Time Telecommuting

Length of Time Telecommuting
As illustrated in Figure 45, approximately four in ten (38%) respondents who telecommuted started telecommuting within the past two years and 16% started within the past year. Three in ten (29%) said they had been telecommuting more than five years. On average, respondents had been telecommuting about 56 months. This was a slightly longer duration than had been estimated in 2007 (53 months) and considerably longer than the 42 months average measured in the 2004 SOC survey. In the 2004 SOC survey, nearly half (49%) of telecommuters started telecommuting within the past two years and only 19% said they had been telecommuting more than five years.

25-60 months 33%

12-24 months 22%

More than 5 years 29%

Formal or Informal Telecommute Arrangement
Telecommuters were asked if they telecommuted under a formal program or through an informal arrangement with a supervisor. Respondents who did not telecommute were asked if their employer had a telecommute program, even though the respondent did not use it. As shown in Figure 46, 54% of respondents said their employers allowed some telecommuting, either under a formal program (29%) or an informal arrangement (25%). Slightly less than half (46%) of respondents said their employers did not have any telecommute program or that they didn’t know about any program. Figure 46 also presents the distribution of telecommuting availability among respondents who currently telecommuted and those who did not. Telecommuters were much more likely than were other respondents to work for an employer with a formal telecommute program.

Telecommute Arrangements 2004 through 2010 – Figure 47 shows the incidence of telecommute arrangements in 2004, 2007, and 2010. As is clear from the figure, the share of employers that offer or permit telecommuting has increased since 2004. In the 2004 SOC survey, only 35% of respondents noted that their employer allowed telecommuting. In 2007, the share had risen to 41%. By 2010, more than half of respondents said their employer offered some telecommute option. And, as the figure also shows, while both formal and informal telecommute arrangements have grown, formal programs have grown more. In 2004, telecommute arrangements were more often informal, while in 2010, the proportions had reversed and formal telecommute arrangements predominated. Telecommute Arrangement by Employer Type – The availability of
telecommute arrangements varied widely by respondents’ employer types, as illustrated in Table 23. Formal programs were most common among respondents who worked for a federal government agency. Nearly six in ten (57%) respondents who worked for federal agencies said their employer had a formal program, compared to only about 21% of respondents who worked for non-profit organizations, 20% who worked for private employers, and 18% who were employed by state/local agencies. Respondents who worked for non-profit organizations or private employers were most likely to have informal telecommuting. More than three in ten respondents in these two groups said their employers permitted informal telecommuting. State/local government agencies were least likely to permit telecommuting under any arrangement. Only one–third (33%) of these respondents said their employer allowed employees to telecommute.

Telecommute Arrangement by Employer Size
– Telecommute arrangements also varied by the number of employees at respondents’ worksites. These results are presented in Table 24. Respondents who worked for large employers were most likely to have access to a telecommuting program and to have access to a formal program. Seven in ten of these respondents said their employer had a formal program (49%) or permitted informal telecommuting (22%). By contrast, only four in ten respondents who worked for employers with 100 or fewer employees had access to either formal (14%) or informal (25%) telecommuting.

Telecommute Frequency
The frequency with which respondents telecommuted is detailed in Table 25. About two in ten respondents who telecommuted did so infrequently, either for special projects (10%) or less than once per month/only in emergencies (12%). Three in ten (30%) said they telecommuted a few times each month. Slightly under half (48%) said they telecommuted at least one day per week. On average, telecommuters used this arrangement about 1.3 days per week. This overall average 1.3 days per week frequency represents a decline from the 1.5 days per week average observed in the 2007 SOC survey, but is on a par with the 1.3 days per week average estimated in the 2004 survey.

Telecommute Locations
The overwhelming percentage (97%) of telecommuters said they telecommuted exclusively from home. About two percent named another telecommute location, such as a satellite office, library or community center, or Telework Center. One percent mentioned that they telecommuted some days from home, but some days also from another location.

Travel to Telecommute Location Outside the Home
Telecommuters who telecommuted from locations outside their homes traveled an average distance of 8.1 miles to these locations. As shown in Table 26, 81% of these respondents drove alone to the telecommute location. About two in ten used an alternative mode: bus (11%), bicycle (4%), walk (3%), or Metrorail (1%).

In 2004, telecommute arrangements were more often informal, while in 2010, the proportions had reversed and formal telecommute arrangements predominated.

GUARANTEED RIDE HOME
AWARENESS AND USE OF REGIONAL GUARANTEED RIDE HOME (GRH) PROGRAM
Since 1997, Commuter Connections has offered Guaranteed Ride Home to eliminate alternative mode users’ fear of being without transportation in the case of an emergency. The program provides free rides in a taxi or rental car in the event of an unexpected personal emergency or unscheduled overtime. Some employers also offer GRH programs, as was shown a the previous section of this report.

Awareness of GRH
Survey respondents who did not work at home all the time were questioned on their awareness and use of GRH programs. First, they were asked if they knew of a regional GRH program available for commuters who rideshare or use public transportation. As shown in Figure 48, about a quarter (27%) replied there was such a program, 39% mentioned there was no such program, and the remaining 34% were unsure. The figure also shows GRH awareness for 2004 and 2007. Awareness in 2010 was about the same as in 2007, but considerably lower than the awareness in 2004, when 59% of respondents said a regional GRH program existed.

Awareness of GRH by Commute Mode – As shown in Table 27, awareness of GRH services varied by the commute modes respondents were using at the time of the survey. Respondents who primarily carpooled/vanpooled or rode a commuter train were slightly more likely than were other respondents to be aware of the regional GRH program. Awareness was similar for users of other modes.

Awareness of GRH by Home and Work Location – Table 28 displays awareness of GRH services by the home and work locations of respondents. There were no significant differences in awareness by respondents’ home locations, but respondents who worked in the Inner Core area were more likely to know about GRH than were respondents who worked in the Outer Ring areas.

Use of GRH
Five percent of regional commuters said they had registered for or used a GRH service in the past two years. This included respondents who had previously mentioned that they registered for or used a GRH service offered by their employer.

Sponsor of GRH Program
The 328 respondents who had registered for or used any GRH service were asked who sponsored this service. More than eight in ten (82%) of these respondents said their employers sponsored the programs they had used. Note that the base for this distribution includes respondents who mentioned in a previous question that they had used an employer-provided GRH service. They were not asked who sponsored the GRH program they had used, but they were included in the results to this question. About 13% of respondents noted Commuter Connections or MWCOG/COG as the sponsor of the program. This was much lower than the 37% who mentioned Commuter Connections as the sponsor in 2007.

NUMBER OF DAYS WORKED PER WEEK AND WORK HOURS Full-Time vs Part-Time
Nearly nine in ten (87%) respondents worked full-time, defined as 35 or more hours per week. The remaining 13% were employed part-time. Respondents were assigned to work an average of 4.9 days per week. Some respondents worked one or more weekend days, so the average number of weekdays worked was slightly less, 4.7 days per week. And respondents traveled an average of 4.2 weekdays per week to a work location outside their homes.

Work at Home
About eight percent of the total survey respondents said they never commuted to a work location outside their homes. The majority of these respondents (6% of total respondents) said they were self-employed and had no other work location. The remaining two percent of respondents said they telecommuted from home every day they worked. These two groups of respondents were not asked further questions about commute patterns, but were included in questions about awareness of commute advertising and demographics. Additionally, respondents who telecommuted five days per week were asked questions about their telework experience.

CURRENT COMMUTE MODE
Respondents were asked what modes they used to travel to work each weekday (Monday-Friday) during the survey week. If they were sick, on holiday or vacation, or otherwise absent from work one or more days during the week, respondents were asked to report how they likely would have traveled to work on those days. Figures 49 through 51 present several different views of modal distribution.

The figure also includes the mode share for telecommute and compressed work schedule (CWS). These are not actually travel modes, but this figure includes them to show the percentage of weekly work trips that were eliminated through use of these work schedule options. In 2010, commuters made less than two-thirds (64.2%) of weekly commute trips by driving alone. Transit accounted for more than one in five trips. The second most popular mode was train, used for 14.5% of weekly trips and bus was used for about six percent (5.7%). Respondents used carpool or vanpool for 7.0% of weekly commute trips and made a small share of trips (2.3%) by bike or walking. Telecommute and compressed work schedule days off eliminated slightly more than six percent (6.3%) of weekly work trips. As noted earlier, these “trips” actually were not made, but they were officially assigned as part of the work week, so were included in this distribution. If the telecommute and compressed schedule days off are excluded, to estimate the “on the road” mode share, the percentage use of each of the five travel modes increases. Without telecommute and CWS, the drive alone share would rise to 68.5% of weekly commute trips. The weekly commute trip distribution would be:

Primary Mode – Nearly all (99%) respondents said they used a single mode most days per week. Since most respondents worked five or more days per week, Primary Mode generally equated to use three or more days per week. But for a small percentage of respondents who worked fewer than five days or who used more than two modes, the primary mode could be used just two days per week. As with mode split by weekly trips, the most common Primary Mode was drive alone, used by 65% of respondents. The second most common Primary Mode, used by 15% of respondents, was train. Seven percent said they primarily carpooled, “casual” carpooled (slug), or vanpooled. Bus was the Primary Mode of six percent of respondents. Two percent of respondents said they primarily biked or walked and four percent said they primarily telecommuted.

Drive alone was still the most popular mode overall; 69% of respondents used this mode either regularly or occasionally. The four percent difference between this 69% figure and the 65% of respondents who primarily drove alone is the secondary use of the mode. One percent of respondents used train as a Secondary Mode, increasing to 16% the share of respondents who used train one or more days per week. Carpooling/vanpooling, bus, and bike/walk similarly had one percent of Secondary Mode use. The greatest difference between the Primary Mode and Primary or Secondary Mode distributions was in the percentage of respondents who telecommuted. Four percent of respondents said they primarily telecommuted (Primary Mode) but 12% said they telecommuted at least one day per week (Primary or Secondary Mode). The eight percent difference between these two percentages is the secondary use of telecommute.

Mean Days Used
Figure 52 shows the average number of days each mode/mode group was used. All of modes were used at least three days per week on average and except for bicycle and walk, all modes were used at least four days per week. This is consistent with other results in the survey, which show that most commuters used one mode most of the time for their commute.

Mode Use within Mode Groups
Figure 53 shows relative use of individual modes within four of the travel alternative mode groups displayed in Figure 51.

Train – The train mode group was comprised of Metrorail and three commuter rail companies: MARC (Maryland commuter rail), Virginia Railway Express (VRE), and Amtrak. Metrorail dominated this category, with 93% of train riders using this mode (15.3% of total 16.5% train ridership). The balance of train ridership was in commuter rail.

Carpool/Vanpool – Among respondents who carpooled, regular carpooling dominated. Nearly nine in ten carpool trips were in regular carpools (6.9% of total 8.1% carpool use). The remaining carpool trips were made in casual carpools or “slugs.” A very small share of this mode group (0.1% of 8.1% total) was made by vanpool. Bus – Regular, scheduled bus/shuttles accounted for nearly all bus use. Less than 2% of bus ridership was in buspools (0.1% of total 6.6% bus use). Bike/Walk – Walking accounted for the majority of the bike/walk mode group. Among users of this mode group, walking attracted three-quarters of the respondents (2.4% of 3.2% of bike/walk use).

Length of Time Using Mode
Respondents were asked how long they had been using modes they reported using one or more days per week. Results are shown in Figure 54 for commuters who drove alone, used transit, carpooled, and used bike/walk. Commuters who drove to work had used this mode an average of 10.7 years, considerably longer on average than had commuters who used alternative modes. Only 24% of drive alone commuters said they started using this mode within the past three years; 45% had used the mode for 10 years or more and almost two-thirds had driven alone for five or more years.

PRIMARY COMMUTE MODE BY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP
Analysis of survey data showed some differences in choice of Primary Mode (mode used most days per week) among various demographic groups. Tables 29 through 34 present distributions of Primary Mode by respondent, ethnic group, age, income, vehicle availability, sex, and location of residence and employment.

As the number of vehicles in the houshold increases, the use of transit declined significantly.

Age
Young respondents (younger than 25 years old) were less likely to drive alone and more likely to use the bus and to walk than were older respondents (Table 30). Use of these modes was consistent for respondents in the other age groups. Carpool/vanpool was used at equal rates by all age groups.

Table 31 presents primary mode by annual household income. Respondents who had incomes of less than $30,000 showed substantially lower share of driving alone than did other income groups. Solo driving was equally common among both moderate and high-income respondents. Bus ridership declined steadily as income increased. When the lowest-income respondents are excluded, use of other modes was essentially the same for most income categories.

Residence and Employment Location
Residence State – As illustrated in
Table 34, respondents’ commute modes differed by where they lived. About seven in ten respondents in Virginia and Maryland primarily drove alone to work, while only four in ten (41%) District of Columbia residents primarily used this mode for commuting. District residents were significantly more likely to use bus, train, bike, or walk to work than were respondents living in other states. The mode shares for Maryland and Virginia residents were statistically the same for all modes.

Employment State – Table 34 also displays Primary Mode by state of employment. Respondents who worked in the District of Columbia were substantially less likely to drive alone to work than were those who worked in Virginia or Maryland. District workers were twice as likely to carpool or ride a bus as were Maryland or Virginia workers. Train use among respondents working in the District was dramatically higher than for other respondents. Residence Ring – Table 34 showed that mode use differed by respondents’ home state. But it differed even more by how close the respondent lived to the center of the region. Figure 55 displays Primary Mode as a function of respondents’ residence “ring.”

Respondents who worked in the District of Columbia were substantially less likely to drive alone to work than were those who worked in Virginia or Maryland.

Fewer than half (49%) of commuters who lived in the Inner Core area, which included the District of Columbia and two Virginia jurisdictions, drove alone. This was much lower than the drive alone rates for the Middle Ring (70%) and the Outer Ring (82%) and higher than the 41% drive alone share noted for the District of Columbia alone. Transit use was nearly as high for the Inner Core as for the District of Columbia alone. This suggests that two Virginia jurisdictions included in the Inner Core are more similar to the District of Columbia in travel mode characteristics than they are to other suburban jurisdictions.

Employment Ring – Figure 56 displays Primary Mode as a function of respondents’ employment location, in the ring designations defined earlier. The mode pattern for employment locations was similar to that for the residence rings, but more pronounced. Fewer than half (47%) of commuters who worked in the Inner Core area drove alone. This was dramatically lower than the drive alone rates for the Middle Ring and Outer Ring; in both of these areas about nine in ten workers drove alone. Transit use was high in the Inner Core, but nearly non-existent for commute trips to Middle Ring and Outer Ring worksites. This pattern obviously reflects both the availability of transit infrastructure in the Inner Core areas as well as the inbound focus of transit service during peak commuting hours.

LENGTH OF COMMUTE Number of Miles

Commuters in the sample had a wide range of commute distances, ranging from less than one mile to more than 100 miles, with an overall average of 16.3 miles one-way. Figure 57 presents the distribution of distance. More than a third of respondents (37%) commuted fewer than 10 miles one-way. Three in ten (29%) traveled between 10 and 19 miles. A small percentage (7%) traveled 40 or more miles.

Commute Travel Time
Survey respondents commuted, on average, about 36 minutes one way. As shown in Figure 58, a third (33%) of respondents commuted 20 minutes or less and 43% commuted between 21 and 45 minutes. Nearly a quarter (24%) traveled more than 45 minutes, with nine percent traveling more than one hour one-way. Commute distances and times have remained stable since 2004. In 2010, commuters traveled an average of 16.3 miles and 36 minutes, essentially the same as in 2007 (16.3 miles and 35 minutes) and 2004 (16.2 miles and 34 minutes).

Commute Distance By Mode
Survey respondents’ travel distance varied by the type of transportation they used to commute (Table 35). Commuter rail riders traveled the farthest, 29.3 miles one-way. Carpoolers/vanpoolers also traveled farther than the mile regional average. Commuter rail, bus, and train riders spent the longest time commuting, at least 48 minutes one-way.

Commute Distance By Home and Work Location

Survey respondents’ travel distance also varied by where they lived and where they worked Table 36 (Table 36). Respondents who lived in the Inner Commute Distance by Home and Work Area Core traveled the shortest distance to work, an Primary Average Distance (mi.) Average Time (min.) Commute Mode (n=__) Average (n=__) Average average of 8.2 miles one-way. Respondents who Home Area lived in the Middle Ring commuted nearly twice Inner Core 1,423 8.2 mi. 1,575 30 min. as far, 15.7 miles. And respondents who lived in Middle Ring 1,470 15.7 mi. 1,589 37 min. the Outer Ring traveled 23.7 miles one-way. Outer Ring 2,634 23.7 mi. 2,676 42 min. Commute distances by work area were less varied. Respondents who worked in the Inner Work Area Core traveled an average of 15.6 miles. Middle Inner Core 2,392 15.6 mi. 2,603 41 min. Ring workers traveled slightly farther, 16.1 miles. Middle Ring 1,818 16.1 mi. 1,869 34 min. Respondents who worked in the Outer Ring travOuter Ring 1,297 18.9 mi. 1,343 29 min. eled the farthest, 18.9 miles one way. Inner Core area residents had the shortest travel times; they traveled an average of 30 minutes one-way. But, while the Inner Core respondents traveled fewer minutes to work than did other respondents, they did not have proportionately shorter travel times; Middle Ring residents traveled only seven minutes longer than did Inner Core residents and Outer Ring residents traveled 12 minutes longer. This is likely due to the higher transit and bike/walk use among Inner Core respondents; transit trips, while short in distance, tend to be longer in time. By contrast with the home area results, respondents who worked in the Inner Core had the longest commute times, an average of 41 minutes one-way. Middle Ring workers and Outer Ring workers commuted 34 minutes and 29 minutes, respectively. The higher travel times for Inner Core workers likely are due to their higher use of transit for commuting and the higher congestion they would encounter in their commute.

Non-Standard Schedule Types Used

Non-Standard Work Schedules Used
Figure 59 shows the distribution of work schedules for respondents who said they worked full-time schedules and commuted to an outside work location. Two-thirds (67%) of these respondents said they worked a “standard” schedule, defined for full-time workers as five or more days per week. Of those who worked a “non-standard” schedule, the most common schedule was flex-time or flexible work hours, used by 27% of respondents. About six percent of respondents worked compressed work schedules; 9/80 schedules were most typical.

NON-STANDARD WORK SCHEDULES


<!----##SPLITTER##-->
Primary Mode by Non-Standard Schedule
Use of non-standard work schedules sometimes has been assumed to reduce the use of alternative modes for commuting, by making it more difficult to maintain a carpool or vanpool or by reducing the possibility of using transit for early or late hour commuting. But as seen from Table 37, respondents who worked a compressed schedule Table 37 actually had higher carpool/vanpool Primary Mode by Use of Non-Standard Schedules Type of Schedule Primary Mode use and lower drive alone use than did Drive Alone Carpool/Vanpool Bus Train Bike/Walk respondents who worked a standard, CWS 55% 13% 9% 22% 1% non-compressed, schedule.

ALTERNATIVE MODE USE CHARACTERISTICS Carpool and Vanpool Occupancy
The average number of occupants in respondents’ carpools and vanpools was 2.5 and 7.6 people, respectively. Overall average carpool occupancy was 2.5. The carpool occupancy was the same as the 2.5 person average from the 2007 survey, but slightly less than the 2.6 person average from the 2004 and 2001 SOC survey. About two-thirds (68%) of carpoolers rode with just one other person. The vanpool average of 7.6 was lower than the 9.9 observed in 2007 and lower still than the 11.4 observed in 2001. This could reflect a continued shift to lower-passenger mini-vans, but the 2010 sample included only 12 vanpoolers, so this result should be viewed cautiously.

Access Mode to Alternative Mode Meeting Points
Table 38 presents how carpoolers, vanpoolers, and transit riders traveled to where they met their rideshare partners or where they started their transit trip. About a third (35%) of respondents walked to the meeting place. One in ten (10%) said they were picked up at home by the carpool or vanpool driver and 12% of respondents said they rode transit to the meeting point. Eleven percent said they drove to the location, but then continued on as the carpool/vanpool driver. Three percent said they were dropped off, for example by a spouse or other household member. Almost three in ten respondents (28%) said they drove to the meeting point, such as a Park & Ride lot or the home of a carpool rider, but left their cars at that ...respondents who location. This is significant, because a large proportion of worked a compressed auto emissions are produced during the first few miles of a vehicle trip, when the engine is cold. Even though these schedule actually trips generally were short, they must be reflected in an air had higher carpool/ quality analysis.

MODE SHIFTS AND TRIAL USE OF MODES Modes Used Before Starting Current Alternative Modes

Respondents who used an alternative mode and said they had used that mode three years or less were asked what modes they previously used. About 15% said they did not have a previous mode to report because they had not been working or commuting in the Washington metropolitan area then or had used only this mode. The remaining respondents reported their previous modes, as shown in Figure 60. Of those who had a previous mode, more than half (53%) of current alternative mode users made a shift Figure 60 Previous Mode of Current Alternative Mode Users from driving alone. The remaining 47% shifted from a (multiple responses permitted) different alternative mode. Two in ten alternative mode users shifted from train and 14% previously used a bus.

Alternative Modes Tried
Respondents who did not work at home full-time were asked about use of alternative modes in the past two years. Respondents who were driving alone at the time of the survey were asked if they had used or tried an alternative mode for their commute. Respondents who were using an alternative mode when the survey was conducted were asked if they had used another alternative mode, other than the mode they were currently using. In the two years prior to the survey, almost a quarter (23%) of commuters used or tried another type of non-drive alone mode that Figure 61 they were not using at the time of the survey (Figure 61). This was Alternative Modes Used/Tried in Past Two Years (multiple responses permitted) a higher percentage than was observed in the 2007 survey (14%), but about the same as the percentages who said they tried other Metrorail 13% alternative modes in the 2004 (22%) and 2001 (24%) surveys.

Reasons for Using Alternative Modes
Respondents who used an alternative mode, either during the survey week or within the past two years were asked why they began using those modes. The reasons are listed in Figure 62, divided into three broad categories of motivations: n Personal benefits – benefits the respondent would expect to receive by using an alternative mode n Commute program – commute assistance services the respondent received that encouraged or assisted use of the alternative mode n Personal circumstances – personal circumstances or changes experienced by the respondent

Respondents Who Used or Tried Other Alternative Modes – Figure 62 also shows reasons
given by “trial users,” for trying or using modes they were no longer using. Several reasons mirrored those that respondents gave for why they used their current alternative mode. To “save money” (8%), “save time” (8%), “tired of driving” (4%), or “avoid congestion” (4%) were common personal benefit reasons. But trial users also cited motivations that were likely temporary. For example, the most common reason, named by 22% of respondents, was that they had “no vehicle available.” For some, this likely was a temporary condition. And 14% cited “weather” as their reason, compared with only three percent of current alternative mode users, suggesting occasional or short-term use. They were less likely to note reasons related to job or home location changes, which would be more permanent in nature.

The remaining respondents lived with at least two other household members. The majority of households were comprised of adults and/or children older than 16 years of age. Only 38% of respondents said their households included one or more children under the age of 16.

Household Vehicle Ownership
Only four percent of respondents said they had no household vehicle. One quarter had one vehicle per household, 42% had two vehicles, and 29% had three or more vehicles. These results are presented in Figure 66. Vehicle ownership differed substantially, however, by where respondents lived. As indicated by Figure 67, vehicle ownership was lower among respondents who lived in the Inner Core than in either the Middle Ring or Outer Ring. Twelve percent of Inner Core respondents said they did not have a household vehicle, compared with only two percent of Middle Ring respondents and one percent of Outer Ring respondents. Inner Core area respondents also were much less likely than were respondents in other areas to have two or more vehicles per household. But this was due in part to their smaller household sizes; only 38% of Inner Core respondents lived in a household with three or more members, compared with 55% of Middle Ring respondents and 68% of Outer Ring respondents.

Type – Respondents were asked for what type of employer they worked and the number of employees at their worksites. These results are shown in Figure 69 and Table 43, respectively. Four in ten (41%) respondents worked for a private sector employer. Government agencies employed about the same share: federal agencies, 24%, and state and local agencies, 12%. About one in ten (13%) worked for a non-profit organization and the remaining 10% were self-employed. Size – The majority of respondents worked for employers that are either very small or very large (Table 43). More than four in ten (44%) worked for firms with 100 or fewer employees. About a quarter (27%) worked for employers that employ 1,000 or more employees.

State/local agency Non-profit 12% 13%

Occupations
Respondents represented many occupations, as shown in Table 44. About six in ten respondents worked in professional (39%) or executive/managerial occupations (21%). Other common occupations included administrative support (12%), and technicians/ technical support (11%).

Nearly 60% of respondents worked for employers that had 100 or more employees.

In 2004 and 2007, respondents were asked a two-question series about each service: did the employer offer it and, if it was offered, did the respondent use that service. It is likely that the 2001 approach could have resulted in lower recall of use for some services in 2004 than was noted in 2001, with the single, non-service specific, question about service use.
