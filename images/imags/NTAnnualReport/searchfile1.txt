Message froM The DireCTor
For over 30 years, norwalk transit system (nts) has provided vital access to community services including; education, health care, employment, and training. in the past year, over two and a half million riders relied on nts to provide a safe and comfortable ride to their destination. We are able to make this commitment to quality service through our family of 150 nts employees, many who have serviced us faithfully for as long as 33 years, (providing equipment maintenance, dispatching, customer service, training and administrative services). We offer sub-regional transportation service throughout the southeast region including the cities of Artesia, Bellflower, cerritos, la habra, la mirada, norwalk, Whittier and santa Fe springs and unincorporated areas of l.A. county. nts, with its 2.7 million passengers, 36 fixed-route buses serving 725 stops on 9 routes; and 21 Dial-A-ride vans, providing paratransit annual trips, provide our community a variety of mobility options. senior citizens, students, and commuters from all walks of life, have the opportunity to access these services seven days a week, 365 days a year. We do this with one of the lowest base fares in the industry (only 60 cents) so that cost does not prohibit access. We are able to serve our passengers quickly and cost effectively because of the attention we pay to maintaining our fleet of buses, and vans. We pride ourselves on being environmentally sensitive. We are the only city in california using two types of alternative fuel hybrid electric technology vehicles.

As you can see, it takes a lot of energy and talent to make sure the transportation needs of our community are met. each day comes with new challenges, but we look forward to solving them and affording this community the best transit service possible. We want to thank our patrons for using nts, the city of norwalk for its constant support and all the employees that make up the norwalk transit family for their devotion to providing efficient and economic public transportation services, in keeping with our commitment to quality, safety and effectiveness. sincerely,

Dispatching System
nts operates a Demand-responsive Dial-A-ride service for the disabled and elderly residents of norwalk; and a General Public Dial-A-ride system for the residents of the city of la mirada. We manage a fleet of 21 paratransit vehicles to provide these services. currently, all dispatch activity for these paratransit vehicles is done manually. the current system requires that dispatch personnel handle incoming reservation calls, take trip detail information and handle trip cancellations. opportunities to improve vehicle productivity and customer service is time consuming and is often an omission in the dynamic environment of a manual dispatch operation.

ProjeCTs
Bus Stop Improvement Project
A total of 194 bus stops were completed with new shelters, benches, schedule holders, and lighting in july 2007. olivas valdez, inc. was the contractor for this project. included in the upgrades are 19 i-shelter™ solar leD lighting systems mounted on Kaleidoscope canopies, as well as 194 units of its fully self-contained, solar-powered i-stoP® leD illuminated bus stops with edge-lit schedules. this project included a complete overhaul of bus stops including landscaping, bus pull-outs, benches, trash receptacles and other street furniture.

in keeping with its mandate and commitment to provide superior public transportation in a safe and efficient manner, the department determined that an automated dispatch system would significantly benefit current service-delivery efforts, allow for more efficient scheduling, improved ontime performance, consistent data collection for mandated reporting, and to facilitate any future expansion considerations. trapeze software Group, inc. has been awarded the contract known as cAD (computer Aided Dispatch system).

Stuff-A-Bus Toy Drive and Canned-Food Drive
norwalk transit has taken an active role in assisting local disadvantaged children and their families within our community during the holidays. our goal in creating the holiday Bus is to create a mobile billboard that advertises the joy of giving during the holidays. For approximately one month each year, one of our buses is fully wrapped in holiday-themed graphics and placed on our various routes. the stuff-A-Bus program is a toy drive aimed at collecting enough toys and articles of clothing to “stuff” an entire transit bus. the items received by our community and the struggling families among us during the holiday season.

collected are donated to local community organizations for distribution to needy children during the holidays. the program has been well

in addition, for two days during the holiday season, nts offers free rides to passengers who donate one can of food on-board the bus. All collected items are donated to the city of norwalk senior services center for its food bank.
