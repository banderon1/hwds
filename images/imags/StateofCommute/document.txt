The primary purpose of Commuter Connections’ program services is to inform commuters of the availability and benefits of traveling to and from work in a manner other than driving alone.

Executive Summary

MWCOG-Commuter Connections— 2010 State of the Commute Report

In 2010, the Commuter Connections program administered by the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB) at the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) conducted the regional State of the Commute survey. Commuter Connections is funded by the District Department of Transportation, the Maryland Department of Transportation, and the Virginia Department of Transportation, with state and federal funds. Commuter Connections is a network of organizations that provides a wide range of transportation program information and commute assistance services in the Washington metropolitan region. The primary purpose of the program services is to inform commuters of the availability and benefits of traveling to and from work in a manner other than driving alone. Another purpose is to assist commuters to find alternatives that fit their commute needs. COG/TPB administers regional commuting services called Transportation Emission Reduction Measures (TERMs) with the goal to reduce vehicle trips, vehicle miles of travel, and emissions. COG has been evaluating the effectiveness of its commuter services since 1997. An established evaluation framework that outlines a detailed methodology and data collection activities to evaluate several regional commuter programs has been updated and revised every three years since 2001. One of the major additions to the framework was the State of the Commute (SOC) survey, which was added in 2001. The SOC is a random sample survey of employed persons in the Washington metropolitan region and serves several purposes. First, it documents trends in commuting behavior, such as commute mode shares and distance traveled, and attitudes about specific commuter transportation services available in the region. The SOC survey is also used to help estimate the impacts of some TERMs, such as Commuter Connections’ Telecommute Assistance and Mass Marketing, two TERMs that might influence the population-at-large as well as commuters who directly participate in Commuter Connections’ programs. By asking commuters about sources of information on alternative modes and their reasons for choosing alternative modes for commuting, the survey examines how other commute alternative programs

and marketing efforts might influence commuting behavior in the region. This report summarizes the survey methodology, presents key results of the survey, and offers conclusions about regional commute travel based on the results, and is divided into several sections which highlight survey results. The survey questionnaire can be found in the Appendix section of this report. The SOC survey documents trends in regional commute behavior, awareness, and attitudes. In some instances, the results are compared against past results as measured in past survey reports. The SOC survey also collects data to support the upcoming TERM evaluation, scheduled for spring 2011. Additional analysis of 2010 SOC data, along with other TERM data collected between 2008 and 2011, is underway and will lead to a final TERM Analysis report that will be prepared and distributed in 2011. Key highlights of the data collected from the 2010 SOC data include: n	 Transportation satisfaction and alternative mode benefits n	 Awareness and attitudes toward transportation options, commute advertising, and commute assistance programs n	 Commuter assistance services provided by employers n	 Telecommuting n	 Regional Guaranteed Ride Home Program n	 Commute patterns

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ALTERNATIVE MODE BENEFITS AND SATISFACTION WITH TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM Commuters recognize both personal and societal benefits of ridesharing.
n

	 When asked what personal benefits users of alternative modes receive from using alternative modes, 90% of respondents named at least one benefit and 53% reported two or more personal benefits. 55% of respondents cited saving money or gas as the top benefit, and eleven percent noted a related cost-saving benefit of reducing wear and tear on one’s personal vehicle. Almost two in ten respondents

7

Nearly two-thirds (64%) of respondents said that use of alternative modes could benefit society by reducing traffic congestion and 45% said it could reduce pollution or help the environment.

said alternative mode users received a benefit of reducing stress (17%) and using travel time productively (17%). n	 Respondents noted three benefits related to environmental concerns. Fifteen percent said commuters who use alternative modes help the environment, indicating recognition that use of alternative modes has an impact of environmental quality and suggesting that alternative mode users can take pleasure in contributing to cleaner air. Four percent noted reducing greenhouse gases and four percent said saving gas or energy, a benefit related to sustainability. n	 Nearly two-thirds (64%) of respondents said that use of alternative modes could benefit society by reducing traffic congestion and 45% said it could reduce pollution or help the environment. One in ten (11%) cited reduced greenhouse gases and six percent noted that society could benefit because roads did not deteriorate as quickly, presumably reducing the cost to maintain or repair roads. Smaller percentages of respondents noted energy savings, reduced government costs, reducing road rage, and reducing accidents.

n

Inner Core and Middle Ring. 	 Commute satisfaction declined dramatically as commute length increased. More than nine in ten commuters who had very short commutes – 10 minutes or less – gave a 4 or 5 rating for satisfaction. When the commute was 21 to 30 minutes, satisfaction dropped to 71%. Less than half of commuters who traveled 31 to 45 minutes were satisfied and when travel time exceeded 60 minutes, only 30% rated their commute a 4 or 5.

Commuters believe the regional transportation system could be improved.
	 About four in ten regional commuters gave high ratings for satisfaction with transportation in the region. While about a quarter (27%) said they were not satisfied (rating of 1 or 2). n	 Respondents who drove alone and those who carpooled/ vanpooled gave the lowest ratings for transportation satisfaction; only 35% were satisfied. Respondents who used transit or bike/walk for commuting gave higher satisfaction ratings. n	 Respondents who lived close to transit gave higher marks for transportation satisfaction than did respondents who lived farther away. Almost six in ten respondents who lived within easy walking distance of a train station were satisfied with transportation, compared with only four in ten or less respondents who lived one mile or more from a train station. n	 There was a clear pattern between commute travel time and transportation satisfaction. Satisfaction declined as the length of the commute increased, from a high of 47% satisfaction for those who had a commute of 10 minutes or less, to 29% for respondents who traveled more than an hour to work. n	 When asked how to improve transportation in the region, respondents focused primarily on ways to improve transit service, with particular emphasis on increasing transit availability and safety. Two in ten respondents proposed Metrorail expansions to more destinations and 17% wanted more bus and train service. Eight percent suggested that Metrorail safety be enhanced.
n

More than half of commuters say they are satisfied with their current commute, but not all commuters are equally satisfied.
	 Six in ten commuters rated their commute satisfaction as a “4” or “5” on a 5-point scale, where “5” meant “very satisfied.” But 16% rated their satisfaction as either a “1 – not at all satisfied” or “2.” n	 Respondents’ commute satisfaction was influenced by the ease of the commute. Three quarters (76%) of respondents who said they had an easier commute than last year and 71% who said their commute had not changed were satisfied with their commute, compared to only 36% who said their commute had become more difficult. n	 Commute satisfaction also differed by where the respondent lived and worked. Respondents who lived in the Inner Core were notably more satisfied with their commute than were respondents who lived in the Middle Ring or Outer Ring. But respondents who worked in the Outer Ring were more satisfied than were respondents who worked in the

Executive Summary

AWARENESS AND ATTITUDES TOWARD TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS, COMMUTE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, AND COMMUTE ADVERTISING Commutes appear to be getting somewhat more difficult, but commuters are making changes to improve their commutes.
n

Most respondents reported access to some transit service in their home area.
	 Respondents were asked to name bus and train companies that provided service in the areas where they lived and worked. Nine in ten said bus and/or train operated in their home area; a similar percentage said service operated in the area where they worked. n	 More than half (54%) of respondents said Metrobus operated near their home and almost six in ten (59%) reported Metrobus in the area where they worked. Similar percentages said that Metrorail/subway operated in their home area (55%) and at work (60%). n	 More than half (53%) of respondents said they lived less than ½ mile from a bus stop and 67% said they lived less than one mile. Train station access was less convenient; only 16% lived less than one mile from a train station. The average distances were 1.4 miles to the nearest bus stop and 6.4 miles to the nearest train station. Respondents who lived in the Inner Core jurisdictions of the District of Columbia, Alexandria, and Arlington said the closest bus stop was an average of 0.3 miles away and a train station was 1.5 miles away on average. Eighty-five percent of commuters in this area lived less than ½ mile from a bus stop.
n

	 A quarter (25%) of respondents said their commute was more difficult than it was a year ago. The primary reason for it being worse was that the route was more congested now (59%), but 14% said it was more difficult due to construction along the route to work.

n

		About 12% of respondents said their commute was easier than last year. The primary reasons were that the trip was a shorter distance (34%), took less time (29%), or was less congested (26%). Eight percent said the commute was easier because they started using an alternative mode. Eleven percent said it was easier because construction along the route had ended.

Respondents considered commuting factors when making job or home change decisions.
n

	 About 17% of respondents said they made a job or home change in the past year. Two in ten of these respondents said they considered a commuting factor, such as the ease or cost of commuting to the new location, when making their location decision and nearly three in ten (29%) said commute ease was more important than other factors in the decision.

n

More than half (54%) of the respondents who used the HOV lanes for commuting said availability of an HOV lane influenced their decision to carpool, vanpool, or ride transit for their commute.

Executive Summary

MWCOG-Commuter Connections— 2010 State of the Commute Report

		Three groups of respondents were more likely than were others to cite commute factors as important to their decision: 1) respondents who lived in the Inner Core jurisdictions, 2) respondents who worked in the Middle Ring jurisdictions, and 3) respondents who moved from another location in the Washington region. Presumably, these three groups expected to encounter a more difficult commute with their move or wanted to improve their commute through the move.

Three in ten respondents have access to HOV lanes for their commutes and HOV availability influences mode choice.
	 Three in ten respondents said there was an HOV lane along their route to work. A quarter (27%) of these commuters said they use the lanes. This equated to about nine percent of commuters region-wide, essentially the same percentages that reported HOV availability and HOV use in 2007. n	 More than half (54%) of the respondents who used HOV lanes for commuting said availability of the lanes influenced their decision to carpool, vanpool, or ride transit for their commute. This is borne out by a comparison of rideshare mode use with and without HOV. The carpool/vanpool mode share was 11% for commuters who had access to an HOV lane for commuting, compared to six percent carpool/vanpool use
n

9

Two-thirds (66%) of respondents said they knew of a telephone number or web site they could use to obtain commute information.

n

for commuters who did not have access to HOV. 	 Respondents who used the HOV lane for commuting estimated that using the lane saved them an average of 23 minutes for each one-way trip. But HOV users who lived in the outer jurisdictions of the region saved an average of 28 minutes one-way. They also were more likely to say the HOV lane had influenced their mode choice. More than half (53%) of Middle Ring respondents (Fairfax, Montgomery, Prince George’s) and 63% of Outer Ring respondents (Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Loudoun, and Prince William) said the HOV lanes influenced their commute mode choice.

Commuters appear interested in HOT lanes and willing to consider ridesharing to use the lanes for a discount.
	 A quarter (26%) of commuters who don’t currently carpool or vanpool said they would be very likely or somewhat likely to start ridesharing to use a High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lane if they would be able to use the lanes for free or a discounted price. n	 A large share of current ridesharers said they were willing to register their carpools/vanpools to receive a discount on HOT lanes; two-thirds said they were either very likely (39%) or somewhat likely (27%) to register their carpool/vanpool to use the lanes at a discount.
n

Awareness of commuter information and assistance resources has grown dramatically since 2001.
	 Two-thirds (66%) of respondents said they knew of a telephone number or web site they could use to obtain commute information. This was higher than the 51% who knew of these resources in 2007 and considerably higher than the 33% of respondents who knew of these resouces in 2001 n	 About 25% of respondents could name a specific number or web site; 12% named a Metro/WMATA phone number or website and three percent mentioned Metro/WMATA, but did not specify the number or website. Almost three percent named a phone number or website administered by Commuter Connections.
n

MWCOG-Commuter Connections— 2010 State of the Commute Report

Awareness of Commuter Connections has grown since 2007.
	 In 2010, 64% of all regional commuters said they had heard of an organization in the Washington region called Commuter Connections. This was higher than the 53% who knew of Commuters Connections in 2007 and about the same percentage as knew of the program in 2004 (66%). n	 When asked to name Commuter Connections services, respondents largely cited services that Commuter Connections actually does provide. Six in ten knew the program offered either general rideshare information (30%) or help finding a carpool or vanpool partner (30%). About a quarter (26%) knew that Commuter Connections offered a regional Guaranteed Ride Home program. Nine percent said Commuter Connections offered transit route and schedule information, which can be accessed through links on Commuter Connections’ web site. Awareness of each individual service was higher in 2010 than in 2007.
n

Most local jurisdiction services are known to at least a quarter of their target populations.
	 Respondents were asked about local commute assistance services provided in the counties where they lived and worked. Awareness of these programs ranged from 10% to 53% of respondents who were asked the questions. Five of the nine programs examined were known to at least a third of their target area respondents. n Use of the services ranged from two percent to 28% of respondents who had heard of the services. Use was generally higher for programs in outer jurisdictions and for programs associated with transit agencies or with a strong transit component. The relationship to the location in the region is likely because outer jurisdiction commuters encounter more congestion in their
n

Executive Summary

travel and have longer commute times and distances, which would encourage them to seek options for travel to work. The transit connection might be due to higher visibility of the services, but 65% of respondents who contacted a local program said they were seeking transit information. In the inner jurisdictions, transit assistance is provided by transit organizations that are separate from the local commute assistance program.

Awareness of commute information advertising remained high.
	 Nearly six in ten (58%) respondents said they had seen, heard, or read advertising for commuting in the six months prior to the survey and 70% of these respondents could cite a specific advertising message. Both the general recall and specific message recall were higher than was observed in the 2007 survey (52% general recall and 65% message recall). n	 More than four in ten respondents who had heard ads could name the sponsor. WMATA was named by 20% as the advertising sponsor. Commuter Connections was named by 13%, a slightly higher percentage than named Commuter Connections in 2007 (9%).
n

respondents who were between 45 and 54 years old. 	 About 19% of respondents who said they were likely to consider ridesharing or public transportation for commuting had taken some action to try to change their commute. These respondents cormprised about two percent of all regional commuters. A large majority (83%) of respondents who took an action to change their commute said the advertising they saw or heard encouraged the action. n	 Most of these respondents sought more information about commuting options but five percent tried or started using a bus, train, or bicycling or walking to work. Prior to starting these new modes, half of the respondents had been driving alone to work. The other half had been using a different alternative mode.
n

COMMUTER ASSISTANCE SERVICES PROVIDED BY EMPLOYERS Availability of worksite commute assistance services is higher than in 2007.
	 Six in ten (61%) respondents said their employers offered one or more alternative mode incentives or support services to employees at their worksites. This is slightly higher than 54% noted in the 2007 and the 53% reported in 2004. n	 The most commonly offered services were transit/vanpool subsidies (45% of respondents), commute information (26%), services for bikers and walkers (24%) and preferential parking (21%). In all cases, these services were more available in 2010 than they had been in 2007. n	 Respondents who worked for federal agencies were most likely to have incentive/support services available (89%), compared with 46-64% of respondents who worked for other types of employers. Respondents who worked for large firms reported greater access to incentive/support services than did respondents who worked for small firms. And incentives and support services were far more common among respondents who worked in the Inner Core jurisictions (Alexandria, Arlington, and District of Columbia); 74% of these respondents had access to services compared to 53% of
n

Commute advertising appears to influence commuters’ consideration of travel options.

Transit/vanpool subsidies and commute information were the most widely used commuter assistance services, used, respectively, by 54% and 33% of respondents who had access to these incentives.

Most commuters continue to have free worksite parking.
	 The majority of respondents (63%) said their employers offered free on-site or off-site parking, about the same percentage as that resported in 2007 (65%), 2004 (66%), and 2001 (65%). n	 Respondents who worked for federal agencies and those who worked for non-profit organizations were least likely to have free parking; only half of these respondents said they had free parking, compared with 71% who worked for private firms and 77% who worked for state/local governments. Free parking was also much less common in the Inner Core area of the region. Only a third of respondents who worked in these areas had free parking, compared with nearly nine in ten respondents who worked in the Middle Ring and Outer Ring.
n

Worksite commuter assistance services appear to encourage use of alternative modes.
	 Driving alone was less common for respondents who had access to incentive/support services. Only 57% of respondents with these services drove alone to work, compared with 80% of respondents whose employers did not provide these services. n	 Respondents whose employers did not offer free parking also used alternative modes at much higher rates. Only four in ten (41%) respondents who did not have free parking drove alone, compared with 82% of respondents who did have free parking.

TELECOMMUTING The percentage of workers who telecommute continued to grow between 2007 and 2010, reaching a milestone of one-quarter of the regional commuting population. Even with this growth, potential exists for additional telecommuting.

These respondents said their job responsibilities would allow them to, and they would like to telecommute. n	 Telecommuting continues to be concentrated in certain demographic and employment groups, but the percentage of all regional commuters who said their jobs were incompatible with telecommuting dropped, from 65% in 2004 to 45% in 2010. Because it seems unlikely that the composition of jobs changed substantially in the region, these results suggest a shift in commuters’ perception of their ability to perform work away from their primary work location. This could be related to increasing availability of communication and computer technology or perhaps from a broader definition of what responsibilities are “telecommute-compatible.”

MWCOG-Commuter Connections— 2010 State of the Commute Report

The percentage of telecommuters who work under “formal” telecommute arrangements equals the percentage who telecommute under informal arrangements with supervisors.
	 About 29% of all respondents (both telecommuters and non-telecommuters) said their employer had a formal telecommute program and 25% said telecommuting is permitted under informal arrangements between a supervisor and employee. Formal programs were most common at federal agencies and among respondents who worked for employers with more than 1,000 employees. n	 Among current telecommuters, 50% telecommute under a formal arrangement.

telecommuting. This appears to signal a greater acceptance of formal telecommuting.

Telecommuters get information on telecommuting from a variety of sources.
n	The

largest source of telecommute information, by far, was “special program at work/employer,” named by 71% of respondents. This percentage was considerably higher than in the 2007 survey, in which only 55% of telecommuters cited their employer as the source of information and higher still compared with the 34% who gave this answer in 2004. n	Six percent of telecommuters said they received telecommute information directly from Commuter Connections or MWCOG. This was about the same percentage that mentioned Commuter Connections/MWCOG in each of the previous three SOC surveys: 2007 (7%), 2004 (5%), and 2001 (4%).

The most popular alternative mode was train, which was used by about 15% of respondents as their primary mode.

COMMUTE PATTERNS The share of commute trips made by driving alone has fallen since 2004 and train use has risen.
	 Drive alone continued to be the most popular commute mode in the Washington metropolitan region but the share of weekly commute trips made to worksites outside the home (excluding telecommuting) declined from 71% in 2001 to 64% in 2010. This represents a drop of seven percentage points over the nine year period. n	 Weekly trips made by transit modes increased from 2001 to 2010. Train use increased from 12.4% in 2001 to 14.5% and bus use grew from 4.6% to 5.7%. The shares of weekly commute trips made by carpool/vanpool remained essentially constant. n	 Three in ten (30%) regional commuters used an alternative mode (carpool, vanpool, bus, Metrorail, commuter rail, bicycle, or walk) as their primary mode, that is, the mode they used most days in a typical week. An additional four percent of commuters used an alternative mode one or two days per week, resulting in more than a third of all regional commuters using a non-drive alone mode at least once per week. n	 The most popular alternative mode was train, which was used by about 15% of respondents as their primary mode. An additional one percent of commuters said they used the train one or two days per week. n	 Bus was the primary commute mode for about six percent of respondents. An additional one percent occasionally rode the bus to work. n	 Carpooling/vanpooling was used by about seven percent of commuters most days during the week and one percent used these modes one or two days per week. The majority of carpoolers used a “traditional” form of carpooling, with the same partner(s) all the time. About one in ten carpoolers/vanpool trips was made by “casual” carpooling (slug).
n

Regional commuters continue to try new alternative modes.
MWCOG-Commuter Connections— 2010 State of the Commute Report

	 Almost a quarter (23%) of respondents had used or tried an alternative mode, other than one they were currently using, within the two years prior to the survey. This represented an increase over the 14% of respondents who said in the 2007 survey that they tried another mode and about the same percentage as reported trial use of alternative modes in the 2004 (22%) and 2001 (24%) SOC surveys. n	 Transit was the mode mentioned most often; 13% of all regional commuters had used or tried the train in the past two years and seven percent tried or used a bus. Four percent tried or used bicycle or walk for commuting. n	 More than half (53%) of the respondents who made a switch to an alternative mode in the past three years switched from driving alone. The other 47% switched from another, different alternative mode. These “retention” switches are important to maintain the congestion mitigation and environmental benefits of past alternative mode shifts.
n

A sizeable portion of commuters who use alternative modes drive alone part of the trip.
n

	 Nearly three in ten (28%) respondents who used an alternative mode said they drove alone to the alternative mode meeting spot (park & ride lot, train station, carpool driver’s home, etc.) and left their cars at those places. Respondents traveled an average of 2.6 miles to these meeting points. A third (35%) of respondents walked to the meeting point and the remaining respondents who used an alternative mode either took transit, or were dropped off by a carpool partner or picked up at home.

Commute lengths remained the same as in 2004.
n

Respondents traveled an average of 16.3 miles and 36 minutes in 2010, essentially the same as in 2007 (16.3 miles, 35 minutes) and 2004 (16.2 miles, 34 minutes).

OVERVIEW
The geographic scope of COG/TPB’s responsibility encompasses the 11 independent cities and counties that make up the Washington metropolitan region. All households within this geographic area that had at least one employed person residing in the household were eligible for selection in the 2010 study. A minimum of 600 random telephone surveys were conducted in each of the 11 jurisdictions of the study area, resulting in 6,629 completed interviews. The primary purpose of conducting this survey was to meet multiple objectives, including trend analysis and TERM evaluation. Wherever possible, an attempt was made to replicate questions used in previous transportation demand management studies to allow for trend analysis. Additionally, the SOC Survey included survey modules specific to four TERMs: Maryland and Virginia Telework, Guaranteed Ride Home, Employer Outreach, and Mass Marketing.

finalized with the study team and translated into Spanish. The survey instrument was designed for telephone administration using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI). A copy of the English questionnaire is included in the Appendix section of this report.

SURVEY AND SAMPLING METHODOLOGY

Survey Administration
The telephone survey was conducted in CIC’s telephone survey facility. Interviews were conducted using the Voxco CATI system. The Voxco system is an integrated survey system encompassing both CATI and Web applications which simplifies survey management while boosting interviewer performance. Before beginning the full survey effort, CIC conducted an interviewer-training session. Items included in the session were: n	 Explanation of the purpose of the study n	 Identification of the group to be sampled n	 Overview of COG and its function n	 Review of the definition and instruction sheet to familiarize interviewers with the terminology n	 Verbatim reading of the questionnaire n	 Paper/CATI review of skip-patterns to familiarize interviewers with questionnaire flow n	 Practice session on CATI systems in full operational mode Interviews were conducted between January 22 and April 30, 2010. A survey pretest was conducted on January 22 and 23 tested the changes to the questionnaire and sample administration. Following the successful pretest, interviewing continued on January 28, 2010. All calls were made to the respondents’ home numbers. Weekday calls were made from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm local time and weekend calls from 10:00 am to 6:30 pm local time. CIC interviewers conducted a minimum of five callback attempts at different times and over different days throughout the data collection period. CIC adopted measures to assure confidentiality of responses. Bilingual interviewers surveyed all Spanish-speaking respondents using the Spanish version of the questionnaire. A total of 74 interviews (1.1%) were completed in Spanish. All interviewing was conducted with survey supervisors present. The survey supervisors were responsible for overseeing

Questionnaire Design
The 2010 SOC questionnaire was based on the questionnaire used in 2007, with modifications and additions as needed. LDA Consulting, CIC Research, and COG/TPB staff modified the survey questionnaire, with input from a TDM Evaluation Group comprised of representatives from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. The survey was intended to meet multiple objectives, including trend analysis and evaluation of two of the TERMs: Telecommuting and Mass Marketing. Wherever possible, the study team retained the 2007 SOC questions to allow trend analysis, but changes were made when the revisions were expected to add substantially to the accuracy of the data. Minor changes were made to the 2007 questionnaire to enhance respondents’ understanding of the question and several questions were deleted to shorten the survey. Several new questions were added to examine significant new transportation topics, including quality of life and satisfaction with the regional transportation system. Before the full survey was conducted, CIC completed a pretest of the questionnaire. The pretest was conducted on January 22 and 23, 2010 resulting in 128 completed interviews. Using the responses to these interviews, the questionnaire was

First, data from the Bureau of Labor Geographic Sub-Areas – Inner Core, Middle Ring, Outer Ring Statistics’ (BLS) Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) were utilized to estimate the number of workers for each of the 11 sampled jurisdictions. This employment information was used to compute jurisdiction-level expansion factors, which were applied to the survey results to determine their proportion for regional analysis. Second, survey results were adjusted to align the sample for ethnicity: Black, Hispanic, White and Other groups. Weighting factors were calculated from ethnicity distributions published in the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS). This is an on-going survey which surveys populations throughout the United States and thus includes the 11 study areas.

GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS
The SOC analysis focused primarily on the region as a whole. However, for some questions, the analysis examined results for individual jurisdictions or other geographic sub-areas of the region. The primary sub-area categorization divided the region into three categories roughly representing concentric rings around the central core (Figure 1). The Inner Core area included the City of Alexandria, Arlington County, and the District of Columbia. The Middle Ring, surrounding the core, included Fairfax, Montgomery, and Prince George’s counties. The Outer Ring included Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Loudoun, and Prince William counties.

SURVEY RESULTS

The key findings of the survey are in this section of the report. The 6,629 completed surveys were weighted to represent the number of employed residents of the metropolitan region and to correct for under-representation of some racial/ethnic groups in the sample. This expansion methodology allows the proper representation of employed residents in each of the 11 jurisdictions in the survey area. Survey result percentages shown in the tables and figures are weighted to the total working population, and in some cases also show the raw number of respondents (e.g., n=__) who answered the question. Some results are basesd on smaller samples of respondents because some questions did not apply to the total sample of 6,629. Survey results are compared for sub-groups of respondents where relevant. Survey results also are compared with corresponding data from the 2007, 2004, and 2001 SOC surveys, where the

comparison is notable. A section comparing key results from the four SOC surveys is also in this report. The results presented include the following: n Transportation satisfaction n Availability of and attitudes toward transportation options n Awareness of commute advertising and services n Awareness of use of commuter assistance resources n Employer-based commuter assistance services n Telecommuting n Guaranteed Ride Home n Commute patterns n Characteristics of the sample

TRANSPORTATION SATISFACTION
A series of questions were added to the 2010 SOC survey to explore commuters’ impressions of the role transportation plays in creating a livable region. These questions focused on: n Quality of life n Satisfaction with transportation and desired improvements n Benefits of ridesharing

QUALITY OF LIFE
The survey asked respondents to rate quality of life in the Washington region, using a five-point scale in which 1 meant “poor” and 5 meant “excellent.” Two-thirds (66%) of respondents gave a high rating for quality of life in the Washington region (rating of 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale). Only nine percent gave a low rating (1 or 2).

Commuters gave lower ratings for their satisfaction with transportation in the region (Figure 2). Only 38% said they were satisfied (rating of 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale) and more than a quarter (27%) said they were not satisfied (rating of 1 or 2)

Satisfaction by Home Location – Respondents who lived in the Inner Core gave somewhat higher ratings for both quality of life and transportation, as shown in Figure 3, than did respondents in either the Middle Ring or Outer Ring. Three quarters of Inner Core respondents rated quality of life a 4 or 5, compared with 65% of Middle Ring respondents and 61% of Outer Ring respondents. About half of Inner Core respondents gave high marks to transportation satisfaction, while only 38% of Middle Ring respondents and 29% of Outer Ring respondents rated transportation satisfaction as high.

Two-thirds (66%) of respondents gave a high rating for quality of life in the Washington region (rating of 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale).

Satisfaction by Commute Mode
Respondents who drove alone and those who carpooled/vanpooled gave the lowest ratings for transportation satisfaction; only 35% were satisfied (Figure 4). Respondents who used transit or bike/walk for commuting gave higher satisfaction ratings. One common trait of these other modes is that the commuters do not need to drive, so they can avoid congestion.

Satisfaction by Travel Time – There was a clear pattern between commute travel time and transportation satisfaction. Satisfaction declined as the length of the commute increased, from a high of 47% satisfaction for respondents who had very short commutes of 10 minutes or less, to 29% for respondents who traveled more than an hour to work.

Satisfaction by Proximity to Transit – A pattern emerged also between satisfaction with transportation and the respondent’s proximity to bus and train stops. Respondents who lived close to transit gave higher marks for transportation satisfaction than did respondents who lived farther away. The pattern was particularly striking for distance to train. Almost six in ten respondents who lived within easy walking distance of a train station were satisfied with transportation, compared with only four in ten or less respondents who lived one mile or more from a train station.

Suggestions to Improve Transportation – The survey interview gave
respondents an opportunity to provide suggestions for how they thought the transportation system could be improved. The question was open-ended, so respondents were free to make any recommendation and to offer multiple ideas. About two in ten respondents said they did not think any improvements were needed and another 10% said they didn’t have any suggestions. Figure 7 presents the ideas proposed by the remaining respondents. A large share of the recommendations focused on ways to improve transit service in the region, with particular emphasis on increasing transit availability and safety. Two in ten respondents proposed Metrorail expansions to more destinations and 17% wanted more bus and train service. Eight percent suggested that Metrorail safety be enhanced. Some respondents noted other types of improvements, such as better regional management/planning of transportation facilities, more funding, and reducing traffic congestion. About four percent volunteered that the region should build more roads or repair existing roads.

Questions were added to the 2010 SOC survey to assess commuters’ opinions about the benefits generated by use of alternative modes and the importance of future investment in alternative transportation. Respondents were asked about the following: 	 n What personal benefits do people who use alternative modes receive from using these types of transportation? 	 n What impacts or benefits does a community or region receive when people use alternative modes?

Personal Benefits of Alternative Mode Use
When asked what personal benefits users of alternative modes receive from using those modes, 90% named at least one benefit and 53% reported two or more personal benefits. Figure 8 details the responses to this question. Saving money or gas topped the list of personal benefits, cited by 55% of respondents. No other benefit came close in the percentage of responses. Eleven percent noted a related cost-saving benefit of reducing wear and tear on one’s personal vehicle. Almost two in ten

respondents said alternative mode users received a benefit of reducing stress (17%) and using travel time productively (17%). One in ten noted that alternative modes offer companionship on the commute. Respondents noted three benefits related to environmental concerns. Fifteen percent said commuters who use alternative modes help the environment, indicating awareness that use of alternative modes has an impact of environmental quality and suggesting that alternative mode users can take pleasure in contributing to cleaner air. Four percent noted reducing greenhouse gases and four percent said saving gas or energy, a benefit related to sustainability.

Figure 9 displays these responses. 3% Save money Nearly two-thirds (64%) of respondents said that use of alternative modes could reduce traffic congestion and 45% said it could reduce pollution or help the environment. One in ten (11%) cited reduced greenhouse gases and six percent noted that society could benefit because roads did not deteriorate as quickly, presumably reducing the cost to maintain or repair roads. Smaller percentages of respondents noted energy savings, reduced government costs, reducing road rage, and reducing accidents.

EASE OF COMMUTE AND COMMUTE SATISFACTION Ease of Commute Compared to Last Year
Respondents who did not telecommute or work at home all the time were asked if their commute time was easier, more difficult, or about the same as it was a year prior. As seen in Figure 10, the majority of respondents (62%) said their commute was about the same as a year ago. A quarter (25%) said their commute was more difficult and 12% said their commute was easier. One percent of respondents said they were not commuting in the Washington region a year ago, so a comparison was not provided. Respondents who said their commute had changed were asked in what way it was easier or more difficult. The top section of Figure 11 presents reasons that respondents’ commutes had worsened. The bottom section of the Figure shows the reasons that respondents’ commutes had improved.

More Difficult Commute – Six in ten respondents who said
their commute was more difficult said their route had become more congested. About two in ten respondents said the trip took more time and 14% said new construction along the route made the trip more difficult. About one in ten said the distance was longer (11%) or that the trains/buses were more crowded (8%).

Easier Commute – The most common reason for an easier commute was that it was shorter, cited by 34% of the respondents. This is likely due to a change in either a work location or home location. About three in ten respondents said the trip was faster (29%) and 26% said the route they used was less congested or that the road had been improved. One in ten respondents (11%) said the commute was easier because construction along the route had ended. A similar share of respondents attributed their easier commute to a change they had made in their travel mode: started using bus/train (5%), started driving to work (4%), or started carpooling/ vanpooling to work (3%).

Influence of Changes in Residence or Work Location
Because it was expected that a commute might have become easier or more difficult because the origin and/or destination of the commute changed, all respondents were asked if they had made a change in their work location and/or home location in the past year. Table 1 displays results of commute ease for respondents who did and did not make a move. About 17% made a change and 83% made no change. Three-quarters (76%) said they moved within the Washington metropolitan region. The other 24% moved from a location outside the Washington area. Because those who moved from outside the region could not provide a before-the-move comparison, they were excluded from the base for Table 1. The percentages shown in the table suggest the ease or difficulty of the commute appears to have been related to moves for at least some of the respondents. The majority (67%) of respondents who did not move said their commutes were about the same. Nine percent said their commute had improved and about a quarter (24%) said it had gotten more difficult. About a third (33%) of respondents who moved said they had a more difficult commute. But almost as large a share (29%) said

their commute had improved. This percentage was much higher than the percentage of respondents who had an easier commute without a move. This suggests that the move might have played a role in either improving or worsening a commute, but that the move improved the commute as often as it worsened it. The table also shows a breakdown of change in commute conditions by the type of move made: home only, work only, or both home and work. The differences between responses for these groups are small and within the statistical margin of error.

About a third (33%) of respondents who moved said they had a more difficult commute.

Commuting as a Factor in Location Change Decisions – Anecdotal reports have suggested that some
commuters might move their residences and/or seek new jobs at least in part because they wanted to make their commute easier or less costly. Several questions were included in the SOC survey in 2007 to examine if commute factors had an influence on regional residents’ home or work location decisions. Respondents who said they had made a change were asked what factors they considered in making the change and how important to their decision the ease of the trip to work was compared to other factors

These questions were designed to measure the impact of the “Live Near Your Work” program that Commuter Connections implemented in 2008. This program encourages employers to inform employees of several state and/or federal financial incentives offered to employees who choose a home location that reduces the distance they travel to work or who choose a home location near a transit stop. In 2010, six percent of respondents who had moved their homes had received information from their employers. This was about the same percentage as reported receiving information in 2007 (7%). Four percent said they received information on financial incentives to move closer to transit, again about the same as the five percent who noted this information in the 2007 SOC survey.

Commute Satisfaction
The 2010 survey included a new question that asked commuters to rate how satisfied they were with their trip to work. As shown in Figure 13, 62% rated their commute satisfaction as a “4” or “5” on a 5-point scale, where “5” meant “very satisfied.” Two in ten gave a rating of “3.” Sixteen percent rated their satisfaction as either a “1” – not at all satisfied (7%) or “2” (9%).

Satisfaction by Commute Ease – Respondents’ level of satisfaction with their commute was influenced by the ease of the commute. As illustrated in Figure 14, 76% of respondents who said they had an easier commute than last year and 71% who said their commute had not changed were satisfied with their commute, compared to only 36% who said their commute had become more difficult.

Satisfaction by Home and Work Location
– Commute satisfaction also differed by where in the region the respondent lived and worked. Figure 15 presents the percentages of commuters in each of the three areas of the region who gave a rating of 4 or 5 for commute satisfaction. Respondents who lived in the Inner Core were notably more satisfied with their commute than were respondents who lived in the Middle Ring or Outer Ring areas. But respondents who worked in the Outer Ring were more satisfied than were respondents who worked in the Inner Core and Middle Ring.

Respondents’ level of satisfaction with their commute was influenced by the ease of the commute... 76% of respondents who said they had an easier commute than last year and 71% who said their commute had not changed were satisfied with their commute.

Satisfaction by Commute Travel Time – Commute satisfaction declined dramatically as commute length increased. As shown in Figure 16, 96% of commuters who had very short commutes – 10 minutes or less – gave a 4 or 5 rating for satisfaction. When the commute was between 11 and 20 minutes, 84% were satisfied. At 21 to 30 minutes, satisfaction dropped still further; only 71% gave a 4 or 5 rating. Less than half of commuters who traveled 31 to 45 minutes were satisfied and satisfaction dropped to 44% for travel times of 46 to 60 minutes. When travel time exceeded 60 minutes, only three in ten said they could rate their commute a 4 or 5.

PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
Respondents who worked outside their homes were asked to name any public transportation companies that provided service in the area where they lived and the area where they worked. Respondents also were asked how far their homes were from the nearest bus stop and the nearest train station.

Table 3 presents the results for the first question. As shown, nine in ten (92%) respondents said that they knew of some public transportation that provided service in their home area. Seven in ten (70%) said they knew of both bus and train service, two in ten (19%) said they knew of bus service but not train, and three percent said they knew of train service but not bus service. The remaining respondents said either that no bus or train companies provided service or that they didn’t know of any service (8%). The percentage who said they knew of transit companies that provided service in their work area was approximately the same as for the home area. Seven in ten (70%) said they knew of both bus and train service, about two in ten (18%) said they knew of bus service only, and two percent said they knew only that train service was provided. One in ten (10%) said that no transit companies operated either bus or rail service in their work area. The specific companies that respondents could Table 4 name are presented in Table 4. Not surprisingly, the Public Transportation Companies that Provide two companies mentioned most frequently for both Service in Home Area and Work Area home and work area were those that operate through(multiple responses permitted) out the region.

Distance to Bus Stop and Train Station
The results presented in Table 4 reflect respondents’ perception of transit availability; they are not an objective measure of transit availability or level of transit access. A respondent who is willing to drive to a bus stop or rail station might consider service that operates within five miles of his home to be “in my home area,” while another respondent who lives within one mile could feel that “no transit operates.” The survey also did not address other factors that might enter into a respondent’s assessment of the practical feasibility of using transit, such as the directness of the trip or the time needed to make the trip. Thus, some respondents might have considered these factors in assessing whether “service was provided” and others might have excluded them from their assessment. To assess a measure of the closeness of transit, all respondents, including those who said no transit operated, were asked the distance from their homes to the nearest bus stop and nearest train station. Figure 18 displays the distribution of access distance. More than half of respondents said they lived less than one-half mile from a bus stop and 67% said they lived less than one mile. Among respondents who could provide a distance to a bus stop, the average distance was 1.4 miles.

Table 5 Train stations were quite a bit farther away for most Mean Distance from Home to Bus Stop and Train Station respondents. Only six percent said they lived less than By Type of Transit Service Operating in Home Area one-half mile from a Metrorail or commuter rail station Bus Stop Train Station and only 16% lived less than one mile. About half (51%) Bus and train provided 0.9 miles 3.8 miles said they lived three or more miles away from the nearest Bus only–no train service provided 1.8 miles 14.5 miles train station. On average, respondents who provided a Train only–no bus service provided 4.9 miles 7.4 miles distance lived 6.4 miles away. No bus or train service/don’t know transit 5.4 miles 13.8 miles Table 5 compares transit access distances for the four “bus available – train available” categories. Again, it is important to emphasize that “service provided” was defined by respondents’ perception. Respondents who said both bus and train service operated in their home area, reported the shortest distance to both bus and train transit access points; they lived 0.9 miles from the nearest bus stop and 3.8 miles from the nearest train station. Respondents who said only bus operated in their home area lived an average of 1.8 miles from a bus stop and 14.5 miles from a train station. Among respondents who reported only access to train, the average bus stop distance was 4.9 miles, greater than in the “bus only” category. But the train station distance of 7.4 miles was much shorter. Respondents were asked to estimate the distance to bus and rail, even if they said neither bus nor rail operated in the area where they lived. As seen in Table 5, respondents who reported no service at all estimated the average bus access distance (5.4 miles) at approximately the More than half of same distance as did respondents who reported access respondents said to “train only” (4.9 miles); that is, no bus access. Similarly, they estimated their train access distance they lived less than (13.8 miles) approximately the same as reported by one-half mile from respondents who said they had “bus only” access a bus stop and 67% (14.5 miles). Because these respondents reported no said they lived less service operating, these distances were clearly beyond the area these respondents classified as their than one mile. “home area.”

Table 6 presents the percentage of respondents in each area who said bus and/or rail operated in their home area. Both bus and train services were more available in the central part of the region than in the outer jurisdictions. In the Inner Core, 99% of respondents said some transit service operated in their home area and 88% said that both bus and train operated. Within the Middle Ring, three-quarters of respondents said both bus and train operated. Transit availability dropped off markedly in the Outer Ring; 82% of respondents said any service operated and only 41% said they had access to both bus and train. Distance to Transit by Home Area Figure 19 presents the distribution of distance for the three area rings. Eighty-five percent of respondents in the Inner Core reported living less than one-half mile from a bus stop, compared to 56% of respondents in the Middle Ring, and 16% of respondents in the Outer Ring. Only three percent of Inner Core respondents lived one or more miles from a bus stop, compared with 55% of Outer Ring respondents. It is also notable that two in ten Outer Ring respondents said they didn’t know how far they lived from a bus stop.

The average transit access distance was the shortest for respondents who lived in the Inner Core; just 0.3 miles to the nearest bus stop and 1.5 miles to the nearest train station. Respondents in the Middle Ring said they would have to travel 0.9 miles to the nearest bus stop and 4.8 miles to the nearest train station. Respondents who lived in the Outer Ring reported that the nearest bus stop was an average of 4.2 miles away and train was 15.5 miles away.

MWCOG-Commuter Connections— 2010 State of the Commute Report

More than a quarter (27%) of commuters who live less than one-half mile from a bus stop commute primarily by bus or train.

Commute Mode by Distance to Bus Stop – As might be expected, the commute mode share of transit declines with increasing distance from a bus stop. Figure 20 presents the mode shares of driving alone, bus/train, and carpool/vanpool for respondents who live various distances from a bus stop. More than a quarter (27%) of commuters who live less than one-half mile from a bus stop commute primarily by bus or train. As the distance from home to a bus stop increases, the transit share falls steadily. When the nearest bus stop is 10 miles from home, only six percent of respondents commute by transit, a drop of 21 percentage points.

These commuters shift almost entirely to driving alone. As the figure shows, the drive alone rate for commuters who live more than 10 miles from a bus stop is 81%, compared to 58% for commuters who live within one-half mile of a bus stop. This represents a 23 percentage point increase for driving alone. Use of carpool/vanpool remains fairly constant at all bus access distances.

Commuters who lived in the Outer Ring used HOV lanes at a higher rate than did commuters in other areas. Nearly four in ten (39%) Outer Ring respondents who had access to HOV lanes said they used them, compared to about a quarter of Inner Core and Middle Ring respondents.

HOV Lane Influence on Commute Choice – HOV lanes appear to have an impact on choice of commute modes. More than half (54%) of the respondents who used the lanes for commuting said availability of the HOV lane influenced their decision to carpool, vanpool, or ride transit for their commute. The influence on carpooling is best illustrated by the drive alone and carpool/vanpool mode shares when HOV lanes are available and when they are not. As shown in Figure 23, about 11% of respondents who said an HOV lane was available to them were carpooling or vanpooling to work, compared with six percent of respondents who did not have access to HOV. Transit use also was higher for respondents who said an HOV lane was available. Conversely, the drive alone rate for respondents who had access to HOV was 63%, compared to 71% for respondents who could not use HOV.

MWCOG-Commuter Connections— 2010 State of the Commute Report

Various HOV studies have suggested that the influence of HOV lanes is due to both the amount of time saved by HOV lanes and the reliability of travel time that HOV lanes afford. Overall, 54% of HOV users said that availability of the lane influenced their decision to choose an alternative mode for commuting. On average, these users saved 23 minutes one-way in their commute time. Figure 24 shows these results. Figure 24 also presents comparison results for the each of the three ring designations. About a quarter of HOV users who lived in the Inner Core reported that HOV availability influenced their mode choice and they saved an average of 13 minutes one-way. HOV lanes’ influence on HOV users who lived in the Middle Ring and Outer Ring was much higher; 53% of Middle Ring respondents and 63% of Outer Ring respondents said the HOV lanes influenced their commute mode choice. They also reported much greater time savings in their commute; 22 minutes and 28 minutes one-way, respectively.

Interest in HOT Lanes

Figure 25 The 2010 survey included two new questions related to commuters’ Likely to try Carpool/Vanpool interest in High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes, which are under construcor to Register Existing Carpool/Vanpool tion or being proposed for several jurisdictions. Respondents were to Receive HOT Lane Discount asked about their interest in carpooling or vanpooling on a toll road 74% that was free or reduced cost for carpools and vanpools. Respondents who were not ridesharing were asked: “Several jurisdictions in the Washington region are building or considering building toll roads. If 39% 34% you could use one of these roads for your trip to work and carpools and 27% vanpools traveled for free or for a reduced toll, how likely would you be 14% 12% to start carpooling or vanpooling to use these roads?” Respondents who were carpooling or vanpooling were asked how likely they would be to register their carpool or vanpool with a regional Try carpool/vanpool Register carpool/vanpool commute organization to be able to receive the discount: “… If you could use one of these roads for your trip to work and carpools and Very likely Somewhat likely Not likely vanpools that registered with a regional commute organization could use these roads for free or for a reduced toll, how likely would you be to register your carpool or vanpool?” Results for both of these questions are presented in Figure 25. About a quarter (26%) of non-ridesharers said they were either very likely (12%) or somewhat likely (14%) to start ridesharing to use the lanes. Current ridesharers were more willing to register their carpools/vanpools to receive the discount; two-thirds said they were either very likely (39%) or somewhat likely (27%) to register their carpool/vanpool to use the lanes at a discount. Interest in HOT lanes did not vary substantially across the three “ring” sub-areas of the region. About 22% of respondents who lived in the Inner Core said they would be likely to try ridesharing. Middle Ring and Outer Ring respondents were only slightly more interested; about 26% of Middle Ring and 30% of Outer Ring respondents said they were likely to try ridesharing to use the lanes at a
reduced price.

PARK AND RIDE LOTS
Figure 26 depicts respondents’ awareness of the locations of Park and Ride (P&R) lots along their route to work. Forty-five percent of respondents across the region said they knew the locations of P&R lots along their commuting route. About a third (32%) said they did not know the locations. A quarter (23%) said there were no P&R lots along their route to work. The figure also shows that awareness/availability of lots varied substantially by home location in the region. Respondents who lived in the Inner Core were least likely to say they knew of a P&R lot on their route; only 23% of these respondents knew of a lot, while 47% of respondents who lived in the Middle Ring and 60% of respondents in the Outer Ring knew of a lot along their route to work. Two in ten (21%) of those who knew Park and Ride lot locations had used these lots when commuting during the past year. These respondents represented nine percent of total respondents in the survey, slightly higher than the seven percent of respondents who reported use of P&R lots in the 2007 SOC survey. Use of P&R lots was more common among respondents who lived in the Middle Ring (24%) and Outer Ring (19%) than for Inner Core (15%) residents. But respondents who worked in the Inner Core used P&R lots at a much higher rate than did other respondents. A third of Inner Core workers who knew of the lots had used them in the past year, compared with just one in ten respondents who worked in the Middle Ring (11%) or Outer Ring (9%).

ATTITUDES TOWARD TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS Carpool/Vanpool Barriers
Respondents who did not carpool or vanpool to work were asked why they did not use these modes. Table 8 shows respondents’ barriers to rideshare use, grouped into three reason categories: service availability, service characteristics, and personal preferences/needs. The most common reason, cited by nearly half (45%) of respondents was one of service availability; that they didn’t know anyone to carpool or vanpool with. Only a small share of respondents noted concerns or barriers related to service characteristics. The most common concern here was that carpooling and vanpooling take too much time. Respondents noted greater barriers related to personal preferences/needs. The most common reason was an irregular schedule, cited by 28% of respondents. About one in ten said they needed a personal vehicle for trips before or after work or that their work responsibilities required use of a vehicle. Six percent of respondents said they lived too close to work to make carpooling or vanpooling attractive and six percent said they did not want to ride with strangers or preferred to be alone during commuting.

Transit Barriers
Respondents who did not use a bus or train for commuting were asked why they did not use transit. Table 9 shows respondents’ barriers to transit use, grouped in the three reason categories: service availability, service characteristics, and personal preferences/needs. Respondents cited reasons in each category. About half of the respondents said they did not use transit because they did not have train service available and three in ten said bus service was not available in either the home or work area. Respondents who did not use bus or train also noted several characteristics of the services as barriers to their use. The top reason in this group was that transit “takes too much time,” mentioned by a third of respondents. Small percentages of respondents noted issues with cost, convenience, comfort, and safety. Common reasons in the personal preferences/needs category included needing a vehicle for work or before or after work, having an irregular work schedule, and that the trip was too long. Smaller shares of respondents said the commute was too short, they needed or wanted travel freedom and flexibility, and that they did not want to ride with strangers.

AWARENESS OF COMMUTE ADVERTISING AND SERVICES
COMMUTE ADVERTISING RECALL
The next set of questions in the survey inquired about respondents’ awareness of commute information advertising. Nearly six in ten (58%) respondents said they had seen, heard, or read advertising about commuting in the six months prior to the survey. This was slightly higher than the 52% recall noted in the 2007 SOC survey.

Message Recall
These respondents were then asked what messages they recalled from this advertising. Seven in ten (70%) could cite a specific message, slightly higher than the 65% who could recall a message in 2007. Figure 27 lists messages respondents in the 2010 survey remembered and the percentage of respondents who cited each message. The messages are divided into two categories: general rideshare messages and commute services messages.

Nine percent of respondents mentioned Guaranteed Ride Home, higher than the six percent who volunteered this response in 2007. Four percent mentioned “contact Commuter Connections,” about the same percentage as gave this response in 2007. An additional three percent said the ad mentioned that regional services were available to help with commuting. Two percent mentioned Telework Centers or telecommuting.

MWCOG-Commuter Connections— 2010 State of the Commute Report

General Rideshare Messages – The top reason noted was a general rideshare message, “use the bus, train, Metrorail,” which was recalled by 14% of respondents. This was less than the 18% who noted this message in 2007. About five percent said they recalled a general message of “carpool or vanpool.” Small numbers of respondents mentioned rideshare benefit messages: helps the environment (6%), saves money (5%), reduces traffic (4%), saves time (2%), and less stressful (2%). Recall of all of these messages was essentially the same as in 2007.

Recall of Advertising Sponsors
Forty-five percent of respondents who had heard or seen ads said they remembered who sponsored the ad. These respondents mentioned the organizations listed in Table 10. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA, Metro) was named by 20% of respondents, the same percentage as noted this sponsor in 2007. Commuter Connections or COG were named by 13% of respondents, slightly higher than the nine percent who gave this response in 2007. The Virginia Department of Transportation and Arlington County Commuter Services each was named by about two percent of respondents. Numerous other organizations were named in 2010, but each was named by less than one percent of respondents.

Other common sources named in 2010 included television (24%), sign on a transit vehicle or at a bus stop or Metro station (22%), and in a newspaper (18%). Smaller shares of respondents cited other sources.

COMMUTE ADVERTISING IMPACT Persuasiveness of Advertising Messages
The advertising appeared to have an effect for some respondents. Almost a quarter (24%) of respondents who had seen, heard, or read advertising said they were more likely to consider ridesharing or using public transportation after seeing or hearing the advertising, higher than the 18% who noted this willingness in 2007 and the same percentage as in 2004. The respondents who were most persuaded by the advertising were those who were already using alternative modes. About 48% of bus riders, 25% of Metrorail riders, and 30% of carpoolers and vanpoolers said they were likely to consider using an alternative after hearing the ads, compared with only 21% of respondents who were driving alone. The advertising appeared to have more impact on younger respondents. As shown in Figure 28, willingness to consider ridesharing declined steadily with increasing age. Nearly half of respondents who were under 25 said they would consider ridesharing, compared with only 17% of those who were 55 to 64 years old and only eight percent of respondents who were 65 or older.

Commute Actions Taken After Hearing or Seeing Commute Advertising
Respondents who said they were more likely to consider alternative modes after hearing the ads were asked if they had taken any actions to try to change how they commuted. About 19% of these respondents said they did take some action. These respondents comprised about two percent of all regional commuters. Specific actions noted are presented in Figure 29. The majority of respondents who took an action said they sought information or services for commuting. Five percent said they looked for a carpool or vanpool partner. Three percent said they looked for more information on the internet, two percent contacted a local or regional commute organization, and one percent contacted a transit operator. Five percent (23 respondents) said they tried or started using an alternative mode for commuting. Two percent tried or started using a bus to get to work, two percent tried or started bicycling or walking to work, and one percent tried or started using a train. Prior to starting these new modes, half of the respondents had been driving alone to work. The other half had been using a different alternative mode.

The respondents who were most persuaded by the advertising were those who were already using alternative modes.

A large majority (83%) of respondents who took an action to change their commute said the advertising they saw or heard encouraged the action.

Influence of Ads on Commute Change Actions
A large majority (83%) of respondents who took an action to change their commute said the advertising they saw or heard encouraged the action. And more than 70% of respondents who took an action were driving alone at that time. This suggests that the advertising, although having a small impact on mode shifts, is acquainting drive alone commuters with other commuting opportunities and encouraging them to seek more information on these options. This conclusion is supported by results of one additional question asked in this section about commute advertising. Respondents who sought information but had not made a commute mode change were asked how likely they were to try a form of transportation other than driving alone for their commute within the next year. As shown in Figure 30, 23% said they were very likely and 40% said they were somewhat likely to try an alternative mode. This is likely an overstatement of actual future changes, but it suggests that an initial effort to seek information might lead to commute changes at a later time.

AWARENESS AND USE OF COMMUTER ASSISTANCE RESOURCES
AWARENESS OF COMMUTER ASSISTANCE NUMBERS/WEBSITES
The next set of questions in the survey investigated commuters’ knowledge and use of regional commute assistance services. First, respondents were asked if they were aware of a telephone number or web site they could use to obtain information on ridesharing, public transportation, HOV lanes, and telecommuting in the Washington region. Two-thirds (66%) of respondents said they knew such a number existed. The remaining respondents either said there was not such a phone number or website (15%) or that they did not know if a phone number or web site existed (19%). As illustrated in Figure 31, awareness of regional commute information resources has grown steadily over the past nine years. The current level of 66% awareness is 15 percentage points higher than in 2007 and twice as high as in 2001.

Recall of Web Sites and Phone Numbers
When respondents who had said there was a regional phone number or web site were questioned on their recall of the actual number or web site, about four in ten, or 25% of all regional workers, could name a specific number or web site. Table 12 summarizes the awareness of all numbers/web sites, as percentages of the regional population. About 12% named a specific WMATA phone number or web site and three percent mentioned WMATA or Metro, but did not specify the number or site. Commuter Connections was second only to WMATA as a regional information source, named by almost three percent of all respondents. Respondents named more than 20 additional organizations that they knew or believed offered commuter assistance and information. Each of these was named by less than one percent of respondents, but collectively they accounted for 12% of additional responses. This was much higher than the number of resources mentioned in 2007, suggesting that commuters are more aware of resources and/or that more resources are available now than in 2007.

AWARENESS AND USE OF COMMUTER CONNECTIONS PROGRAM
The “awareness” section of the questionnaire also explored respondents’ awareness of the Commuter Connections Network and the services it offers commuters. Some indications of respondents’ awareness of the program appeared in unprompted questions about regional commute advertising messages, advertising sponsors, and regional commuter information resources. As noted earlier, two percent of the regional population named Commuter Connections as a regional information source without being prompted with the organization’s name. But when directly asked if they had heard of an organization in the Washington region called Commuter Connections, an additional 62% of respondents said they had heard of the program, for a total of 64%. This was higher than the percentage who knew of Commuter Connections in 2007 (53%) and about the same level of name recognition that was observed in 2004 (66%). (See Figure 32).

Referral Sources to Commuter Connections Program
Table 13 displays the methods by which respondents reported learning about Commuter Connections in 2010, with comparisons to sources named in 2007 and in 2004. In 2010, almost half (48%) of respondents cited the radio as their source of information and about 15% named television. Word of mouth/referrals (9%), sign/billboard (7%), and newspaper ads or articles (6%), were other common sources. Smaller percentages cited other sources, including internet (4%), employer (4%), sign on a transit vehicle (4%), or brochure (1%). About 11% said they didn’t remember how they heard about Commuter Connections. The 2010 results were very similar to those observed in 2007.

Awareness and Use of Commuter Connections’ Services
Respondents who knew of Commuter Connections were asked what services the organization provided. Their responses are shown in Figure 33. About three in ten said they didn’t know specific services offered by the program, but respondents who did mention a service largely cited services that Commuter Connections actually does provide. Six in ten knew the program offered either general rideshare information (30%) or help finding a carpool or vanpool partner (30%). About a quarter (26%) knew that Commuter Connections offered a regional Guaranteed Ride Home program. Nine percent said Commuter Connections offered transit route and schedule information, which can be accessed through links on Commuter Connections’ web site.

About a quarter (24%) said they were looking for transit route or schedule information. About one in ten (12%) said they were looking for information about Guaranteed Ride Home.

AWARENESS AND USE OF LOCAL COMMUTER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
Finally, respondents were asked about their awareness and use of local jurisdiction commuter programs that delivered commute assistance services in the areas where they lived and/or worked. If they lived and worked in different jurisdictions, they were asked about both the organization in their home area and the organization in their work area. Figure 34 presents the percentage of respondents who said they had heard of each of the nine organizations, when prompted with the organizations’ names. Awareness of these programs ranged from 10% to 53% of respondents who were asked the questions. Five of nine programs examined were known to at least a third of the target area respondents.

With the exception of Arlington County Commuter Services, use was generally higher for programs in outer jurisdictions (Frederick, Loudoun, and Prince William). The relationship to the location in the region is likely because outer jurisdiction commuters encounter more congestion in their travel and have longer commute times and distances, which would encourage them to seek options for travel to work. Use also was higher for programs associated with transit agencies (Frederick, Loudoun, and Prince William). This connection might be due to higher visibility of the services, but 65% of respondents who contacted a local program said they were seeking transit information. In the inner jurisdictions, transit assistance is provided by transit organizations that are separate from the local commute assistance program.

* Each response in the “Other” category mentioned by less than one percent of respondents.

Information and Services Sought from Local Organizations – Respondents who had contacted a local jurisdiction program were asked what information or services they were seeking. The services desired are shown in Table 15. By far, the most prominent service sought by respondents was transit information, sought by 65% of respondents who contacted a local program. Much smaller percentages said they were looking for Metrochek/SmarTrip fare information (9%), help finding a carpool or vanpool partner (5%), or general rideshare information (4%). The predominance of transit information is reasonable, given that several of the local programs are administered by transit organizations.

EMPLOYER-PROVIDED COMMUTER ASSISTANCE SERVICES
The SOC survey also included questions on commute assistance services and benefits that an employer might provide to employees. Respondents were asked about two types of services: 	n Alternative mode incentives and support services 	n Parking facilities and services This section presents results regarding respondents’ availability of and use of these services in 2010. Results also are presented for some questions from the 2007 and 2004 SOC surveys.

INCENTIVES/SUPPORT SERVICES
More than six in ten (61%) respondents said their employer offered one or more incentives or support services (Figure 36). This is higher than the percentages of respondents who reported having access to these services in 2007 (54%) and 2004 (53%).

The most commonly offered services were SmarTrip/other subsidies for transit/vanpool, available to 45% of respondents, and information on commuter transportation options, available to 26% of respondents. Nearly a quarter (24%) of respondents said their employers here offered services for bikers and walkers, 21% were offered preferential parking for vanpools and carpools, 14% were offered GRH services, and only seven percent were offered carpool subsidies. As shown in the figure, availability of transit/ vanpool subsidies has grown substantially, from 33% to 45% since 2007. Availability of other services also appears to have risen since 2007.

Table 16 compares the percentages of employers that offered various incentives/support services and parking services by employer type. Not surprisingly, federal agency workers also had greater access than other respondents to individual incentive/support service. This was especially true for transit/vanpool subsidies 80% of federal workers said these subsidies were offered, while only 46% of nonprofit workers and three in ten respondents who worked for private firms and state/local agencies had this benefit. Commute information and preferential parking also were disproportionately available to federal agency workers.

Commuter Services Offered by Employer Size
Large employers were more likely to offer commuter services than were small employers. As indicated by Table 17, only 44% of respondents who worked for employers with 100 or fewer employees and 58% of respondents who worked for employers with 101-250 employees said they had any services. By contrast, seven in ten (71%) respondents employed by large (251-999 employees) employers and more than eight in ten (82%) respondents who worked for very large firms (1,000+ employees) had one or more employer-provided commuter service.

Finally, the analysis examined the Incentives/Support Services Percentage of Employers Offering Service availability of services by respondents’ work Inner Core Middle Ring Outer Ring locations, divided into the three “ring” Any services offered 74% 53% 40% designations described earlier: Inner Core Transit subsidy 65% 31% 14% (Alexandria, Arlington, and the District of Commute information 33% 27% 17% Columbia), Middle Ring (Fairfax, Montgomery, Preferential parking 27% 22% 13% and Prince George’s), and Outer Ring (Calvert, GRH 16% 15% 15% Charles, Frederick, Loudoun, and Prince Carpool subsidy/cash payment 10% 8% 4% William). As shown in Table 18, Inner Core Bike/walk services 28% 21% 14% respondents had greater access to incentive/ support services than did other respondents. Three-quarters of Inner Core workers said they had commute services, while only half of Middle Ring workers and 40% of Outer Ring workers had access to these services. Inner Core workers also had greater access to each individual service; two-thirds of these respondents were offered transit subsidies, compared to a third of respondents who worked in the Middle Ring, and only 14% of respondents who worked in the Outer Ring. Inner Core workers had somewhat higher access to other commute services also. These differences were less dramatic, but there was a clear pattern of highest availability in the Inner Core, moderate availability in the Middle Ring, and significantly lower availability of most services in the Outer Ring.

Respondents also were asked about the Parking Facilities/Services Offered by Employers – 2010, 2007, 2004 Parking Facilities and Services Employer Offered Service parking services available at their worksites. 2010 SOC 2007 SOC 2004 SOC These results are displayed in Table 19 for Free on-site parking 63% 65% 66% 2010, 2007, and 2004.

The availability of free parking appears to be the same as in 2007 and 2004.

Parking by Employer Type – Federal agency workers and respondents who worked for non-profit organizations were least likely to have free parking at work. About 49% of respondents who worked for federal agencies and 50% of respondents who worked for a non-profit said their employer provided free parking. Other workers in these two groups either had no parking at all or had to pay all or part of the cost of parking. By contrast, 77% of respondents who worked for state and local agencies and 71% of respondents who worked for private employers said they had free parking.

Three-quarters of Inner Core workers said they had commute services, while only half of Middle Ring workers and 40% of Outer Ring workers had access to these services.

Parking by Employer Size – Figure 38 also shows parking availability by employer size. Respondents who worked for large employers were less likely to have free parking. About half (51%) of respondents who worked for companies with 1,000 or more employees had free parking, compared with nearly seven in ten respondents who worked for employers with 250 or fewer employees. Parking Services by Work Location –
Dramatic differences between respondents who worked in different parts of the region also are evident for parking availability. As can be seen in Figure 38, only a third (34%) of respondents employed in the Inner Core area said they had free parking on-site, compared to nearly nine in ten (88%) respondents who worked in the Middle Ring and (90%) of respondents who worked in the Outer Ring.

USE AND IMPACT OF COMMUTER ASSISTANCE SERVICES/BENEFITS
Respondents whose employers offered incentives/support services were asked if they had ever used these services. These results are provided in Figure 39. The most commonly used incentives/support services were transit/vanpool subsidies, used by 54% of respondents whose employers offered this service, commute information, used by 33% of respondents who had access to this service, and Guaranteed Ride Home, used by about a quarter of respondents. About one in five had used preferential parking, bike/walk services, and carpool subsidies.

These differences were significant at the 95% confidence level, but it is not possible to say that the availability of these services was the only reason, or even the primary reason, for the differences in mode use. As noted before, employers in the Inner Core were much more likely than were employers in the Middle Ring and Outer Ring to offer commuter assistance services and drive alone rates were much lower for respondents who worked in the Inner Core (46%) than for respondents who worked in either the Middle Ring (65%) or Outer Ring (76%). But respondents who work in the Inner Core also could be faced with greater impediments to driving alone. For example, respondents who work in the Inner Core traveled an average of 41 minutes to work, compared with 34 minutes for Middle Ring workers and 29 minutes for Outer Ring workers. And respondents who work in the Inner Figure 40 Core also might experience Primary Commute Mode greater congestion levels by Commuter Services/Benefits Reported Offered and have greater avail80% ability of commute options, Drive alone such as transit, than would 57% be experienced by workers outside this area.

Commute Mode by Parking Services Offered
Figure 41 presents a comparison of mode use rates for respondents who had free on-site parking at work and those who either had to pay for parking or who had no parking at all. The difference in drive alone rates for these two groups was dramatic; 82% of respondents who had free parking drove alone, compared with only four in ten (41%) respondents who did not have this benefit. Respondents who had to pay for parking used all alternative modes at higher rates than did respondents who had free parking. The difference was especially striking for use of the train; train mode share was more than six times as high for respondents who did not have free parking as for respondents who did. Many other surveys and research studies have documented the important role parking availability and cost play in commute decisions. But as was noted above, many factors influence commuters’ mode choice.

Interest in Telecommuting
Respondents who did not telecommute and who were not self-employed/work at home full-time were asked if their job responsibilities would allow them to work at a location other than their main work place, at least occasionally. Approximately 40% said it would be possible. These respondents were then asked if they would want to telecommute. Seven in ten said they would be interested in telecommuting on either an occasional basis (42%) or a regular basis (27%). These interested respondents equal about 28% of non-telecommuters and 21% of all commuters. These results suggest additional telecommute growth potential exists in the Washington metropolitan region. Figure 43 summarizes the telecommute status of all respondents who are “commuters,” that is, not self-employed/work at home full-time. A quarter of regional commuters currently telecommute. An additional 21% of commuters “could and would” telecommute, that is, they have job responsibilities that could be done away from the main work place and they would be interested in telecommuting, if given an opportunity. These commuters represent about 500,000 potential telecommuters. The remaining respondents said they would not be interested in telecommuting (9%) or that their job responsibilities could only be performed at the main workplace (45%). Table 20 presents the results shown above, with additional comparisons for current and potential telecommute percentages measured in 2007 and in 2004. As shown in the table, the percentage of current plus potential telecommuting has grown

occasionally. This could be related to increasing availability of communication and computer technology, such as broadband internet, lower cost telephone options, and computer networking, or perhaps from greater understanding of telecommuting options and a broader definition of what responsibilities are “telecommute-compatible.”

$100,000 and $139,999 telecommuted, compared with only about two percent of workers with incomes below $30,000 and six percent of workers with incomes between $30,000 and $59,999. Four in ten (39%) respondents with annual household incomes of $180,000 or more telecommuted. As shown in Table 21, telecommuting also increased with increasing commute distance. Only 12% of respondents who lived less than one mile from work telecommuted, while three in ten (30%) respondents who commuted 30 miles or more telecommuted. There were no significant differences in telecommuting by home or work areas: Inner Core, Middle Ring, and Outer Ring. Table 21 also illustrates which groups have the greatest potential for future telecommuting. That is, in which groups would non-telecommuters be most likely to telecommute in the future, if given the opportunity? The last column in the table shows percentages of non-telecommuters who believe their job responsibilities would allow telecommuting and who would like to telecommute. This is the group referred to as “could and would.” In general, the groups with the highest current use of telecommuting show the greatest additional potential and groups with low current telecommuting also show low potential. But some groups had noticeably higher potential than the 28% average among all nontelecommuters. These included highincome respondents ($100,000 or more annual income) and respondents with longer than average commute distances (15 miles or more).

Sources of Telecommute Information
Respondents who telecommuted were asked how they had learned about telecommuting and if they had received telecommute information from Commuter Connections or MWCOG, either from Commuter Connections or from an MWCOG web site. The most frequently mentioned sources are shown in Figure 44. The largest source of information, by far, was “special program at work/employer,” named by seven in ten (71%) of respondents. This percentage was considerably higher than in the 2007 survey, in which only 55% of telecommuters cited their employer as the source of information and higher still compared with the 34% who gave this answer in 2004. Fifteen percent said they “initiated the request on their own” and five percent said they learned of telecommuting through “word of mouth.” Both had declined as telecommute information sources since 2007, when they were named by 23% and 13%, respectively Six percent of telecommuters said they received telecommute information directly from Commuter Connections or MWCOG. This was about the same percentage as mentioned Commuter Connections/MWCOG in each of the previous three SOC surveys: 2007 (7%), 2004 (5%), and 2001 (5%).

TELECOMMUTE PATTERNS
Respondents who said they telecommuted, at least occasionally, were asked a series of questions about their telecommute characteristics including: length of time telecommuting, use of informal or formal telecommute arrangement, telecommute location, frequency of telecommuting, and access mode to telework locations outside the home.

Figure 45
Length of Time Telecommuting

Length of Time Telecommuting
As illustrated in Figure 45, approximately four in ten (38%) respondents who telecommuted started telecommuting within the past two years and 16% started within the past year. Three in ten (29%) said they had been telecommuting more than five years. On average, respondents had been telecommuting about 56 months. This was a slightly longer duration than had been estimated in 2007 (53 months) and considerably longer than the 42 months average measured in the 2004 SOC survey. In the 2004 SOC survey, nearly half (49%) of telecommuters started telecommuting within the past two years and only 19% said they had been telecommuting more than five years.

25-60 months 33%

12-24 months 22%

More than 5 years 29%

Less than one year 16%

Formal or Informal Telecommute Arrangement
Telecommuters were asked if they telecommuted under a formal program or through an informal arrangement with a supervisor. Respondents who did not telecommute were asked if their employer had a telecommute program, even though the respondent did not use it. As shown in Figure 46, 54% of respondents said their employers allowed some telecommuting, either under a formal program (29%) or an informal arrangement (25%). Slightly less than half (46%) of respondents said their employers did not have any telecommute program or that they didn’t know about any program. Figure 46 also presents the distribution of telecommuting availability among respondents who currently telecommuted and those who did not. Telecommuters were much more likely than were other respondents to work for an employer with a formal telecommute program. Half of telecommuters said they telecommuted Figure 46 under a formal arrangement and the other Formal or Informal Telecommute Arrangements half telecommuted under an informal All respondents and Telecommuters vs Non-Telecommuters arrangement with their supervisor.

Telecommute Arrangements 2004 through 2010 – Figure 47 shows the incidence of telecommute arrangements in 2004, 2007, and 2010. As is clear from the figure, the share of employers that offer or permit telecommuting has increased since 2004. In the 2004 SOC survey, only 35% of respondents noted that their employer allowed telecommuting. In 2007, the share had risen to 41%. By 2010, more than half of respondents said their employer offered some telecommute option. And, as the figure also shows, while both formal and informal telecommute arrangements have grown, formal programs have grown more. In 2004, telecommute arrangements were more often informal, while in 2010, the proportions had reversed and formal telecommute arrangements predominated. Telecommute Arrangement by Employer Type – The availability of
telecommute arrangements varied widely by respondents’ employer types, as illustrated in Table 23. Formal programs were most common among respondents who worked for a federal government agency. Nearly six in ten (57%) respondents who worked for federal agencies said their employer had a formal program, compared to only about 21% of respondents who worked for non-profit organizations, 20% who worked for private employers, and 18% who were employed by state/local agencies. Respondents who worked for non-profit organizations or private employers were most likely to have informal telecommuting. More than three in ten respondents in these two groups said their employers permitted informal telecommuting. State/local government agencies were least likely to permit telecommuting under any arrangement. Only one–third (33%) of these respondents said their employer allowed employees to telecommute.

Telecommuting

Telecommute Arrangement by Employer Size
– Telecommute arrangements also varied by the number of employees at respondents’ worksites. These results are presented in Table 24. Respondents who worked for large employers were most likely to have access to a telecommuting program and to have access to a formal program. Seven in ten of these respondents said their employer had a formal program (49%) or permitted informal telecommuting (22%). By contrast, only four in ten respondents who worked for employers with 100 or fewer employees had access to either formal (14%) or informal (25%) telecommuting.

Cumulative Percentage 10% 22% 52% 71% 83% 100%

Telecommute Frequency
The frequency with which respondents telecommuted is detailed in Table 25. About two in ten respondents who telecommuted did so infrequently, either for special projects (10%) or less than once per month/only in emergencies (12%). Three in ten (30%) said they telecommuted a few times each month. Slightly under half (48%) said they telecommuted at least one day per week. On average, telecommuters used this arrangement about 1.3 days per week. This overall average 1.3 days per week frequency represents a decline from the 1.5 days per week average observed in the 2007 SOC survey, but is on a par with the 1.3 days per week average estimated in the 2004 survey.

Telecommute Locations
The overwhelming percentage (97%) of telecommuters said they telecommuted exclusively from home. About two percent named another telecommute location, such as a satellite office, library or community center, or Telework Center. One percent mentioned that they telecommuted some days from home, but some days also from another location.

Travel to Telecommute Location Outside the Home
Telecommuters who telecommuted from locations outside their homes traveled an average distance of 8.1 miles to these locations. As shown in Table 26, 81% of these respondents drove alone to the telecommute location. About two in ten used an alternative mode: bus (11%), bicycle (4%), walk (3%), or Metrorail (1%).

In 2004, telecommute arrangements were more often informal, while in 2010, the proportions had reversed and formal telecommute arrangements predominated.

GUARANTEED RIDE HOME
AWARENESS AND USE OF REGIONAL GUARANTEED RIDE HOME (GRH) PROGRAM
Since 1997, Commuter Connections has offered Guaranteed Ride Home to eliminate alternative mode users’ fear of being without transportation in the case of an emergency. The program provides free rides in a taxi or rental car in the event of an unexpected personal emergency or unscheduled overtime. Some employers also offer GRH programs, as was shown a the previous section of this report.

Awareness of GRH
Survey respondents who did not work at home all the time were questioned on their awareness and use of GRH programs. First, they were asked if they knew of a regional GRH program available for commuters who rideshare or use public transportation. As shown in Figure 48, about a quarter (27%) replied there was such a program, 39% mentioned there was no such program, and the remaining 34% were unsure. The figure also shows GRH awareness for 2004 and 2007. Awareness in 2010 was about the same as in 2007, but considerably lower than the awareness in 2004, when 59% of respondents said a regional GRH program existed.

Awareness of GRH by Commute Mode – As shown in Table 27, awareness of GRH services varied by the commute modes respondents were using at the time of the survey. Respondents who primarily carpooled/vanpooled or rode a commuter train were slightly more likely than were other respondents to be aware of the regional GRH program. Awareness was similar for users of other modes.

GUARANTEED RIDE HOME

Awareness of GRH by Home and Work Location – Table 28 displays awareness of GRH services by the home and work locations of respondents. There were no significant differences in awareness by respondents’ home locations, but respondents who worked in the Inner Core area were more likely to know about GRH than were respondents who worked in the Outer Ring areas.

Use of GRH
Five percent of regional commuters said they had registered for or used a GRH service in the past two years. This included respondents who had previously mentioned that they registered for or used a GRH service offered by their employer.

Sponsor of GRH Program
The 328 respondents who had registered for or used any GRH service were asked who sponsored this service. More than eight in ten (82%) of these respondents said their employers sponsored the programs they had used. Note that the base for this distribution includes respondents who mentioned in a previous question that they had used an employer-provided GRH service. They were not asked who sponsored the GRH program they had used, but they were included in the results to this question. About 13% of respondents noted Commuter Connections or MWCOG/COG as the sponsor of the program. This was much lower than the 37% who mentioned Commuter Connections as the sponsor in 2007.

NUMBER OF DAYS WORKED PER WEEK AND WORK HOURS Full-Time vs Part-Time
Nearly nine in ten (87%) respondents worked full-time, defined as 35 or more hours per week. The remaining 13% were employed part-time. Respondents were assigned to work an average of 4.9 days per week. Some respondents worked one or more weekend days, so the average number of weekdays worked was slightly less, 4.7 days per week. And respondents traveled an average of 4.2 weekdays per week to a work location outside their homes.

Work at Home
About eight percent of the total survey respondents said they never commuted to a work location outside their homes. The majority of these respondents (6% of total respondents) said they were self-employed and had no other work location. The remaining two percent of respondents said they telecommuted from home every day they worked. These two groups of respondents were not asked further questions about commute patterns, but were included in questions about awareness of commute advertising and demographics. Additionally, respondents who telecommuted five days per week were asked questions about their telework experience.

CURRENT COMMUTE MODE
Respondents were asked what modes they used to travel to work each weekday (Monday-Friday) during the survey week. If they were sick, on holiday or vacation, or otherwise absent from work one or more days during the week, respondents were asked to report how they likely would have traveled to work on those days. Figures 49 through 51 present several different views of modal distribution.

The figure also includes the mode share for telecommute and compressed work schedule (CWS). These are not actually travel modes, but this figure includes them to show the percentage of weekly work trips that were eliminated through use of these work schedule options. In 2010, commuters made less than two-thirds (64.2%) of weekly commute trips by driving alone. Transit accounted for more than one in five trips. The second most popular mode was train, used for 14.5% of weekly trips and bus was used for about six percent (5.7%). Respondents used carpool or vanpool for 7.0% of weekly commute trips and made a small share of trips (2.3%) by bike or walking. Telecommute and compressed work schedule days off eliminated slightly more than six percent (6.3%) of weekly work trips. As noted earlier, these “trips” actually were not made, but they were officially assigned as part of the work week, so were included in this distribution. If the telecommute and compressed schedule days off are excluded, to estimate the “on the road” mode share, the percentage use of each of the five travel modes increases. Without telecommute and CWS, the drive alone share would rise to 68.5% of weekly commute trips. The weekly commute trip distribution would be:

The comparison shows that the share of drive alone trips appears to have declined since 2001, from 71.0% to 64.2%. Transit and Telecommute/CWS both gained mode share since 2001. Transit use increased from 17.0% to 20.2% and Telecommute/CWS more than doubled, from 2.3% in 2001 to 6.3% in 2010. The carpool/vanpool and bike/walk mode shares have remained essentially constant.

MWCOG-Commuter Connections— 2010 State of the Commute Report

Primary Mode – Nearly all (99%) respondents said they used a single mode most days per week. Since most respondents worked five or more days per week, Primary Mode generally equated to use three or more days per week. But for a small percentage of respondents who worked fewer than five days or who used more than two modes, the primary mode could be used just two days per week. As with mode split by weekly trips, the most common Primary Mode was drive alone, used by 65% of respondents. The second most common Primary Mode, used by 15% of respondents, was train. Seven percent said they primarily carpooled, “casual” carpooled (slug), or vanpooled. Bus was the Primary Mode of six percent of respondents. Two percent of respondents said they primarily biked or walked and four percent said they primarily telecommuted.

Drive alone was still the most popular mode overall; 69% of respondents used this mode either regularly or occasionally. The four percent difference between this 69% figure and the 65% of respondents who primarily drove alone is the secondary use of the mode. One percent of respondents used train as a Secondary Mode, increasing to 16% the share of respondents who used train one or more days per week. Carpooling/vanpooling, bus, and bike/walk similarly had one percent of Secondary Mode use. The greatest difference between the Primary Mode and Primary or Secondary Mode distributions was in the percentage of respondents who telecommuted. Four percent of respondents said they primarily telecommuted (Primary Mode) but 12% said they telecommuted at least one day per week (Primary or Secondary Mode). The eight percent difference between these two percentages is the secondary use of telecommute.

Mean Days Used
Figure 52 shows the average number of days each mode/mode group was used. All of modes were used at least three days per week on average and except for bicycle and walk, all modes were used at least four days per week. This is consistent with other results in the survey, which show that most commuters used one mode most of the time for their commute.

Mode Use within Mode Groups
Figure 53 shows relative use of individual modes within four of the travel alternative mode groups displayed in Figure 51.

Train – The train mode group was comprised of Metrorail and three commuter rail companies: MARC (Maryland commuter rail), Virginia Railway Express (VRE), and Amtrak. Metrorail dominated this category, with 93% of train riders using this mode (15.3% of total 16.5% train ridership). The balance of train ridership was in commuter rail.

Carpool/Vanpool – Among respondents who carpooled, regular carpooling dominated. Nearly nine in ten carpool trips were in regular carpools (6.9% of total 8.1% carpool use). The remaining carpool trips were made in casual carpools or “slugs.” A very small share of this mode group (0.1% of 8.1% total) was made by vanpool. Bus – Regular, scheduled bus/shuttles accounted for nearly all bus use. Less than 2% of bus ridership was in buspools (0.1% of total 6.6% bus use). Bike/Walk – Walking accounted for the majority of the bike/walk mode group. Among users of this mode group, walking attracted three-quarters of the respondents (2.4% of 3.2% of bike/walk use).

Length of Time Using Mode
Respondents were asked how long they had been using modes they reported using one or more days per week. Results are shown in Figure 54 for commuters who drove alone, used transit, carpooled, and used bike/walk. Commuters who drove to work had used this mode an average of 10.7 years, considerably longer on average than had commuters who used alternative modes. Only 24% of drive alone commuters said they started using this mode within the past three years; 45% had used the mode for 10 years or more and almost two-thirds had driven alone for five or more years.

PRIMARY COMMUTE MODE BY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP
Analysis of survey data showed some differences in choice of Primary Mode (mode used most days per week) among various demographic groups. Tables 29 through 34 present distributions of Primary Mode by respondent, ethnic group, age, income, vehicle availability, sex, and location of residence and employment.

Table 29 shows Primary Mode for various ethnic groups. White respondents were the most likely to drive alone and were much less likely than other groups to use the bus. Hispanic respondents were the most likely to carpool of all ethnic groups. African-American respondents were statistically more likely to use the train than were either White or Hispanic respondents.

As the number of vehicles in the houshold increases, the use of transit declined significantly.

Age
Young respondents (younger than 25 years old) were less likely to drive alone and more likely to use the bus and to walk than were older respondents (Table 30). Use of these modes was consistent for respondents in the other age groups. Carpool/vanpool was used at equal rates by all age groups.

Table 31 presents primary mode by annual household income. Respondents who had incomes of less than $30,000 showed substantially lower share of driving alone than did other income groups. Solo driving was equally common among both moderate and high-income respondents. Bus ridership declined steadily as income increased. When the lowest-income respondents are excluded, use of other modes was essentially the same for most income categories.

Commute Patterns

Residence and Employment Location
Residence State – As illustrated in
Table 34, respondents’ commute modes differed by where they lived. About seven in ten respondents in Virginia and Maryland primarily drove alone to work, while only four in ten (41%) District of Columbia residents primarily used this mode for commuting. District residents were significantly more likely to use bus, train, bike, or walk to work than were respondents living in other states. The mode shares for Maryland and Virginia residents were statistically the same for all modes.

Employment State – Table 34 also displays Primary Mode by state of employment. Respondents who worked in the District of Columbia were substantially less likely to drive alone to work than were those who worked in Virginia or Maryland. District workers were twice as likely to carpool or ride a bus as were Maryland or Virginia workers. Train use among respondents working in the District was dramatically higher than for other respondents. Residence Ring – Table 34 showed that mode use differed by respondents’ home state. But it differed even more by how close the respondent lived to the center of the region. Figure 55 displays Primary Mode as a function of respondents’ residence “ring.”

Respondents who worked in the District of Columbia were substantially less likely to drive alone to work than were those who worked in Virginia or Maryland.

Fewer than half (49%) of commuters who lived in the Inner Core area, which included the District of Columbia and two Virginia jurisdictions, drove alone. This was much lower than the drive alone rates for the Middle Ring (70%) and the Outer Ring (82%) and higher than the 41% drive alone share noted for the District of Columbia alone. Transit use was nearly as high for the Inner Core as for the District of Columbia alone. This suggests that two Virginia jurisdictions included in the Inner Core are more similar to the District of Columbia in travel mode characteristics than they are to other suburban jurisdictions.

Employment Ring – Figure 56 displays Primary Mode as a function of respondents’ employment location, in the ring designations defined earlier. The mode pattern for employment locations was similar to that for the residence rings, but more pronounced. Fewer than half (47%) of commuters who worked in the Inner Core area drove alone. This was dramatically lower than the drive alone rates for the Middle Ring and Outer Ring; in both of these areas about nine in ten workers drove alone. Transit use was high in the Inner Core, but nearly non-existent for commute trips to Middle Ring and Outer Ring worksites. This pattern obviously reflects both the availability of transit infrastructure in the Inner Core areas as well as the inbound focus of transit service during peak commuting hours.

LENGTH OF COMMUTE Number of Miles

Commuters in the sample had a wide range of commute distances, ranging from less than one mile to more than 100 miles, with an overall average of 16.3 miles one-way. Figure 57 presents the distribution of distance. More than a third of respondents (37%) commuted fewer than 10 miles one-way. Three in ten (29%) traveled between 10 and 19 miles. A small percentage (7%) traveled 40 or more miles.

Commute Travel Time
Survey respondents commuted, on average, about 36 minutes one way. As shown in Figure 58, a third (33%) of respondents commuted 20 minutes or less and 43% commuted between 21 and 45 minutes. Nearly a quarter (24%) traveled more than 45 minutes, with nine percent traveling more than one hour one-way. Commute distances and times have remained stable since 2004. In 2010, commuters traveled an average of 16.3 miles and 36 minutes, essentially the same as in 2007 (16.3 miles and 35 minutes) and 2004 (16.2 miles and 34 minutes).

Commute Patterns

Commute Distance By Mode
Survey respondents’ travel distance varied by the type of transportation they used to commute (Table 35). Commuter rail riders traveled the farthest, 29.3 miles one-way. Carpoolers/vanpoolers also traveled farther than the mile regional average. Commuter rail, bus, and train riders spent the longest time commuting, at least 48 minutes one-way.

Commute Distance By Home and Work Location

Survey respondents’ travel distance also varied by where they lived and where they worked Table 36 (Table 36). Respondents who lived in the Inner Commute Distance by Home and Work Area Core traveled the shortest distance to work, an Primary Average Distance (mi.) Average Time (min.) Commute Mode (n=__) Average (n=__) Average average of 8.2 miles one-way. Respondents who Home Area lived in the Middle Ring commuted nearly twice Inner Core 1,423 8.2 mi. 1,575 30 min. as far, 15.7 miles. And respondents who lived in Middle Ring 1,470 15.7 mi. 1,589 37 min. the Outer Ring traveled 23.7 miles one-way. Outer Ring 2,634 23.7 mi. 2,676 42 min. Commute distances by work area were less varied. Respondents who worked in the Inner Work Area Core traveled an average of 15.6 miles. Middle Inner Core 2,392 15.6 mi. 2,603 41 min. Ring workers traveled slightly farther, 16.1 miles. Middle Ring 1,818 16.1 mi. 1,869 34 min. Respondents who worked in the Outer Ring travOuter Ring 1,297 18.9 mi. 1,343 29 min. eled the farthest, 18.9 miles one way. Inner Core area residents had the shortest travel times; they traveled an average of 30 minutes one-way. But, while the Inner Core respondents traveled fewer minutes to work than did other respondents, they did not have proportionately shorter travel times; Middle Ring residents traveled only seven minutes longer than did Inner Core residents and Outer Ring residents traveled 12 minutes longer. This is likely due to the higher transit and bike/walk use among Inner Core respondents; transit trips, while short in distance, tend to be longer in time. By contrast with the home area results, respondents who worked in the Inner Core had the longest commute times, an average of 41 minutes one-way. Middle Ring workers and Outer Ring workers commuted 34 minutes and 29 minutes, respectively. The higher travel times for Inner Core workers likely are due to their higher use of transit for commuting and the higher congestion they would encounter in their commute.

Non-Standard Schedule Types Used

Non-Standard Work Schedules Used
Figure 59 shows the distribution of work schedules for respondents who said they worked full-time schedules and commuted to an outside work location. Two-thirds (67%) of these respondents said they worked a “standard” schedule, defined for full-time workers as five or more days per week. Of those who worked a “non-standard” schedule, the most common schedule was flex-time or flexible work hours, used by 27% of respondents. About six percent of respondents worked compressed work schedules; 9/80 schedules were most typical.

NON-STANDARD WORK SCHEDULES

Primary Mode by Non-Standard Schedule
Use of non-standard work schedules sometimes has been assumed to reduce the use of alternative modes for commuting, by making it more difficult to maintain a carpool or vanpool or by reducing the possibility of using transit for early or late hour commuting. But as seen from Table 37, respondents who worked a compressed schedule Table 37 actually had higher carpool/vanpool Primary Mode by Use of Non-Standard Schedules Type of Schedule Primary Mode use and lower drive alone use than did Drive Alone Carpool/Vanpool Bus Train Bike/Walk respondents who worked a standard, CWS 55% 13% 9% 22% 1% non-compressed, schedule.

ALTERNATIVE MODE USE CHARACTERISTICS Carpool and Vanpool Occupancy
The average number of occupants in respondents’ carpools and vanpools was 2.5 and 7.6 people, respectively. Overall average carpool occupancy was 2.5. The carpool occupancy was the same as the 2.5 person average from the 2007 survey, but slightly less than the 2.6 person average from the 2004 and 2001 SOC survey. About two-thirds (68%) of carpoolers rode with just one other person. The vanpool average of 7.6 was lower than the 9.9 observed in 2007 and lower still than the 11.4 observed in 2001. This could reflect a continued shift to lower-passenger mini-vans, but the 2010 sample included only 12 vanpoolers, so this result should be viewed cautiously.

Access Mode to Alternative Mode Meeting Points
Table 38 presents how carpoolers, vanpoolers, and transit riders traveled to where they met their rideshare partners or where they started their transit trip. About a third (35%) of respondents walked to the meeting place. One in ten (10%) said they were picked up at home by the carpool or vanpool driver and 12% of respondents said they rode transit to the meeting point. Eleven percent said they drove to the location, but then continued on as the carpool/vanpool driver. Three percent said they were dropped off, for example by a spouse or other household member. Almost three in ten respondents (28%) said they drove to the meeting point, such as a Park & Ride lot or the home of a carpool rider, but left their cars at that ...respondents who location. This is significant, because a large proportion of worked a compressed auto emissions are produced during the first few miles of a vehicle trip, when the engine is cold. Even though these schedule actually trips generally were short, they must be reflected in an air had higher carpool/ quality analysis.

Distance to Alternative Mode Meeting Point
As shown in Table 39, most access trips to alternative mode meetings points were short. Respondents traveled an average of 2.6 miles to the meeting point. Six in ten (60%) respondents traveled one mile or less; these were primarily bus and Metrorail riders. About three in ten (28%) respondents said they traveled between two and five miles. Only 12% of respondents traveled more than five miles.

MODE SHIFTS AND TRIAL USE OF MODES Modes Used Before Starting Current Alternative Modes

Respondents who used an alternative mode and said they had used that mode three years or less were asked what modes they previously used. About 15% said they did not have a previous mode to report because they had not been working or commuting in the Washington metropolitan area then or had used only this mode. The remaining respondents reported their previous modes, as shown in Figure 60. Of those who had a previous mode, more than half (53%) of current alternative mode users made a shift Figure 60 Previous Mode of Current Alternative Mode Users from driving alone. The remaining 47% shifted from a (multiple responses permitted) different alternative mode. Two in ten alternative mode users shifted from train and 14% previously used a bus.

Alternative Modes Tried
Respondents who did not work at home full-time were asked about use of alternative modes in the past two years. Respondents who were driving alone at the time of the survey were asked if they had used or tried an alternative mode for their commute. Respondents who were using an alternative mode when the survey was conducted were asked if they had used another alternative mode, other than the mode they were currently using. In the two years prior to the survey, almost a quarter (23%) of commuters used or tried another type of non-drive alone mode that Figure 61 they were not using at the time of the survey (Figure 61). This was Alternative Modes Used/Tried in Past Two Years (multiple responses permitted) a higher percentage than was observed in the 2007 survey (14%), but about the same as the percentages who said they tried other Metrorail 13% alternative modes in the 2004 (22%) and 2001 (24%) surveys.

Reasons for Using Alternative Modes
Respondents who used an alternative mode, either during the survey week or within the past two years were asked why they began using those modes. The reasons are listed in Figure 62, divided into three broad categories of motivations: n Personal benefits – benefits the respondent would expect to receive by using an alternative mode n Commute program – commute assistance services the respondent received that encouraged or assisted use of the alternative mode n Personal circumstances – personal circumstances or changes experienced by the respondent

alternative mode users noted motivations in each of the three categories. The most common personal benefit reasons were to “save money” (18%) or “save time” (10%). In the commute program category they cited “found carpool partner” (8%). Seven percent noted either limited parking or a parking charge and four percent said they had received a financial incentive. Personal circumstances reasons included “changed jobs or work hours” (15%), “no vehicle available” (10%), “live close to work or to transportation pick-up location” (8%), and “moved residence” (7%).

Respondents Who Used or Tried Other Alternative Modes – Figure 62 also shows reasons
given by “trial users,” for trying or using modes they were no longer using. Several reasons mirrored those that respondents gave for why they used their current alternative mode. To “save money” (8%), “save time” (8%), “tired of driving” (4%), or “avoid congestion” (4%) were common personal benefit reasons. But trial users also cited motivations that were likely temporary. For example, the most common reason, named by 22% of respondents, was that they had “no vehicle available.” For some, this likely was a temporary condition. And 14% cited “weather” as their reason, compared with only three percent of current alternative mode users, suggesting occasional or short-term use. They were less likely to note reasons related to job or home location changes, which would be more permanent in nature.

...vehicle ownership was lower among respondents who lived in the Inner Core than in either the Middle Ring or Outer Ring.

Fifteen percent of respondents said they were the only member of their household and about three in ten (32%) of respondents lived with one other person (Figure 65). The remaining respondents lived with at least two other household members. The majority of households were comprised of adults and/or children older than 16 years of age. Only 38% of respondents said their households included one or more children under the age of 16.

Household Vehicle Ownership
Only four percent of respondents said they had no household vehicle. One quarter had one vehicle per household, 42% had two vehicles, and 29% had three or more vehicles. These results are presented in Figure 66. Vehicle ownership differed substantially, however, by where respondents lived. As indicated by Figure 67, vehicle ownership was lower among respondents who lived in the Inner Core than in either the Middle Ring or Outer Ring. Twelve percent of Inner Core respondents said they did not have a household vehicle, compared with only two percent of Middle Ring respondents and one percent of Outer Ring respondents. Inner Core area respondents also were much less likely than were respondents in other areas to have two or more vehicles per household. But this was due in part to their smaller household sizes; only 38% of Inner Core respondents lived in a household with three or more members, compared with 55% of Middle Ring respondents and 68% of Outer Ring respondents.

* Note that in 2004 and 2007, this series of questions was asked differently than in 2001. In 2001, respondents were asked if the employer offered each of the services listed above, then were asked a general question to name any services they had used. In 2004 and 2007, respondents were asked a two-question series about each service: did the employer offer it and, if it was offered, did the respondent use that service. It is likely that the 2001 approach could have resulted in lower recall of use for some services in 2004 than was noted in 2001, with the single, non-service specific, question about service use.
